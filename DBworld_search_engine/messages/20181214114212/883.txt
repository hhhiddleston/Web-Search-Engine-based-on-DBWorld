Scope and Topics

Robotic Computing (RC) addresses the synergetic interaction of computing technologies and robotic technologies. The synergy between Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science is both realistic and strategic. Their mutual benefit is to make it possible to build and evolve new robotic systems, to reduce their development cost, and to enhance their quality.

The Third IEEE International Conference on Robotic Computing (IRC 2019, aka Robotic Computing 2019) is inviting high quality research papers addressing the synergies between Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in all applications.
