Research and Software Engineering Positions in Innovation Projects for Industry 4.0, Smart Manufacturing and Internet Platform Technologies at Salzburg Research, Austria.
 
We have up to four open positions for post-graduate or post-doc candidates wishing to work with the latest software technologies for smart manufacturing and cloud-based Internet Platforms.

---- Who are we? ----
Salzburg Research is an ICT research and development firm financed to one third by local government and to two thirds by external research contracts. We are over 60 people organized in four research groups.
 
Salzburg Research’s IOT group is active (as coordinator and research partner) in several EU ICT projects as well as in large national R&D projects, always in collaboration with industry partners. We follow a permissive open source strategy (typically Apache 2.0 or similar) that makes it possible for partners and employees alike, to re-use our results for commercial or academic follow-up.
 
We are now entering a new large scale European project and have several national and European projects ongoing. We therefore want to extend and strengthen our team in four areas
-       UX/UI development, e.g. for web-based supply chain and logistics applications
-       Cloud software design, development and deployment of Internet Platforms
-       Cybersecurity, privacy, trust and reputation
-       Machine Learning and data analytics
 

---- Who are you? ----
You have a BSc degree in software engineering and solid experience in developing microservice-based systems, or MSc/ PhD in Computer Science, Mathematics or Engineering with a solid background in Cybersecurity and Machine Learning,  and you enjoy applied research and development. We are specifically looking for people who are developing open source software, and who are well versed in Java or Python.
 
In order to qualify for the above jobs, you need to have significant practical knowledge in one of the above areas and the willingness to spend the next three years with us. We typically offer open-term contracts so as long as we are successful as a group, you will have the opportunity to work with us.
