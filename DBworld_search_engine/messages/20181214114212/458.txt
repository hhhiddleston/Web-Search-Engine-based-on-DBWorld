Call for Papers "MobIS-Challenge for Students and Doctoral Candidates: Model-Based Compliance in Information Systems"

Workshop at the 14th International Conference on Wirtschaftsinformatik (WI) 2019, February 24th 2019, Siegen, Germany

https://bpm.dfki.de/mobis-challenge/

==================================================

Nowadays, business processes are increasingly carried out digitally, with the help of IT systems. This not only allows for an easier reconstruction of processes based on the built-in logging mechanisms. It also facilitates to identify violations of internal or external compliance rules. In this context, new research streams have emerged to develop new methods and techniques to analyze the process data logged by an IT system and to use the gained insights for the benefit of the company. Against this backdrop, the participants of the MobIS-Challenge are supposed to identify different opportunities to use IT tools for analyzing and improving process compliance, for example by examining the compliance of an existing process and pointing out its weaknesses.

Goals of the MobIS-Challenge

The competition is aimed in particular at students and doctoral candidates in the field of business informatics, information systems and related fields. The participants shall analyze a set of business travel management process data provided on the workshop website (https://bpm.dfki.de/mobis-challenge/) with IT tools of their choice (e.g. existing process mining tools, BPM solutions, but also self-developed programs) to identify compliance violations and problematic incidents and to provide solutions for securing the compliance of a future as-is-process. In addition, they are welcome to identify weaknesses in the process or the organization beyond conformance issues and make suggestion for their improvement. The exact task definition and some guiding questions can be found on the above website. The challenge submissions will be examined and compared regarding their results and selected method for addressing the task on hand. The best solutions will be presented during the workshop.
