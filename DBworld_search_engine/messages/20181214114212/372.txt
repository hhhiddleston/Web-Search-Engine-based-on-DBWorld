Call for papers for a special issue of journal Information Systems (Elsevier) on Big Data for Smart Cities

https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-systems/call-for-papers/information-systems-on-big-data-for-smart-cities

In urban spaces, there is a huge amount of heterogeneous data being generated by a diversity of sources, such as sensors, devices, vehicles, smart buildings, and others. Although they are used to monitor basic services, they can provide significant information about human interactions and populational dynamics. Moreover, people constantly interact with each other through social media services, and much of interpersonal interaction is nowadays mediated by information technology. Citizens consume and share information about their cities - such as problems, events, ideas, suggestions, criticisms, and demands – acting as ‘human sensors’, forming opinions and participating in the city evolution.

These data explosion has resulted in the emerging topic of “Big Social Data”. Broadly speaking, Big Social Data refers to large data volumes that relate to people interactions or describe their behaviors, needs, and patterns. The volume, the production and spreading velocity, and the variety (providing semantic richness) of such data open enormous possibilities for utilizing and analyzing them for the understanding of urban spaces, tackling the major issues that these localities face, and helping in the creation of smarter and sustainable cities.

A better understanding of how city ecosystems work can remedy a wide range of issues affecting the everyday lives of citizens and the long-term health and efficiency of cities. The use of Big Social Data helps us to understand the nature of urban phenomena and even predict the future of cities, creating solution to reduce costs and optimize resource consumption, improve population mobility, provide higher human life quality, enhance decision making in emergency scenarios, and engage more effectively with citizens for a continuous city planning.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

•Data mining of social data for urban planning
•Social data analytics for city evaluation
•Social data integration or fusion
•Social IoT
•Knowledge integration
•Social, Knowledge and Big Data integration
•Urban and city dynamics sensoring
•Crowd dynamics at large scale of events
•Big social data applied to neglected populations
•Traffic and human mobility
•Big social data modeling, visualization, analysis, and prediction
•Urban economics based on social data
•Social behavior modeling, understanding, and patterns mining in urban spaces
•Ethical issues in social data analysis
•Public safety, security, and privacy in urban sensing
•Semantics for big social data
•Visualization of city-wide social data in urban areas
•Smart recommendations in urban spaces
•Mining data from the internet of things in urban areas
•Managing urban big social data in the cloud
•Big social data and IoT frameworks and infrastructures
•Smart city open data
•Ubiquitous/pervasive intelligent social systems in urban areas
•Understanding urban economy based on big social data
•Location-based social networks enabling urban computing scenarios
•Intelligent delivery services in cities
•Influences from the real physical world on social data, and vice versa


Paper Solicitation:

This issue is an open special issue where everyone is encouraged to submit papers. We will solicit papers through two ways: selected papers from BiDU workshop and open call-for-papers.

1. Open Call-For-Papers

We also plan to publicize an open call-for-papers (CFP) by listing the CFP in major academic announcement mailing lists/websites and by sending the CFP to researchers in the related fields around the world. We estimate there will be a number of submissions via the open call-for-papers. We plan to compose the SI with about half of the papers coming from the open call and half of the papers coming from the selected papers from the workshop.

Each paper (including the selected papers from the workshop) will go through a rigorous peer-review process by at least three international researchers. In total, we plan to include 5 papers in this Special Issue.

2.Selected Papers from the Workshop on Big Social Data and Urban Computing (BiDU 2018)

BiDU 2018 aims to bring together computer scientists & engineers, to discuss and exchange experimental and theoretical results, work-in-progress, novel designs, and test-environments or test-beds in the areas of Big Social Data and Urban Computing. The workshop website is https://sites.google.com/view/bidu2018/

We intend to select the papers from workshop which are relevant to the theme of this Special Issue. Papers will be selected from the accepted papers based on the reviews (comments and scores) and the presentations during the event. Each selected paper must be substantially extended, with at least 30% new content.

Submission Guidelines:

Original, high-quality contributions that are not yet published or that are not currently under review by other journals or peer-reviewed conferences are sought. Papers will be peer-reviewed by independent reviewers and selected based on originality, scientific quality and relevance to this Special Issue. The journal editors will make final decisions about the acceptance of the papers.

Authors should prepare their manuscript according to the Guide for Authors available from the online submission page of the Information System Journal at https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-systems/ . 

The deadline for manuscript submissions is: December 31, 2018. To ensure that your manuscript is correctly identified for inclusion into the special issue, it is important that you select: Issue: << SI: Big Data for Smart Cities>>
