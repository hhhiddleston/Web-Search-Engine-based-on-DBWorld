We welcome submissions that identify challenges, report experiences, and discuss progress towards design, solutions or vision/ideas of IoT and Big Data applications. Contributions describing techniques applied to real-world problems, novel networking architectures, system designs and applications and interdisciplinary research involving integration of IoT devices (including wearables), mobile, edge and cloud resources and machine learning techniques are especially encouraged.


Relevant topics include but are not limited to:
***********************

- Applications, case studies and deployments of IoT and Big Data systems
- Novel system, networking, service architectures for specific IoT verticals
- Trust, Security, Privacy, and Authentication in IoT
- Dependability, adaptation, intermittency, and assembly in IoT
- Designing and deploying IoT systems for healthcare, retail, manufacturing, transportation and security
- Deployments and evaluation of sensor networks in large-scale industrial settings
- Experiences in managing wearable devices, smart-home systems and mobile sensor networks
- Novel system designs, deployments and applications of aerial vehicles
- Last-mile communication challenges and novel networking protocols
- Use of low power wireless technologies in IoT devices and applications
- System designs to balance network delay, network throughput, and device energy trade-offs
- Challenges and solutions in IoT data and stream processing at the edge and in the cloud
