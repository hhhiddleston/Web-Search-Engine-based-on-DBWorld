PAPER SUBMISSION
***************
Paper submission must be in English and adhere to the double-blind review policy. Submissions must have all details identifying the author(s) removed from the original manuscript, and the author(s) should refer to their own prior work in the third person and include all relevant citations. All papers will be double-blind reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of technical quality, relevance to data mining, originality, significance, and clarity. All paper submissions will be handled electronically. Papers that do not comply with the Submission Policy will be rejected without review. 

Each submitted paper should include an abstract up to 200 words and be no longer than 12 single-spaced pages with 10pt font size (including references, appendices, etc.). Authors are strongly encouraged to use Springer LNCS/LNAI manuscript submission guidelines for their initial submissions. All papers must be submitted electronically through the paper submission system in PDF format only. If required supplementary material may be submitted as a separate PDF file, but reviewers are not obligated to consider this, and your manuscript should therefore stand on its own merits without any supplementary material. Supplementary material will not be published in the proceedings.

The submitted papers must not be previously published anywhere and must not be under consideration by any other conference or journal during the PAKDD review process. Submitting a paper to the conference means that if the paper was accepted, at least one author will complete the regular registration and attend the conference to present the paper. For no-show authors, their papers will not be included in the proceedings. Before submitting your paper, please carefully read and agree with the PAKDD Paper Submission Policy and No-Show Policy: https://pakddsc.webfactional.com/policies/  

The conference will confer several awards including Best Paper Award, Best Student Paper Award, and Best Application Paper Award from the submissions. 

The proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer as a volume of the LNAI series, and selected excellent papers will be invited for publications in special issues of high-quality journals including Knowledge and Information Systems (KAIS) and International Journal of Data Science and Analytics.
