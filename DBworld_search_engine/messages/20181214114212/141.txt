Security & Privacy in Social Big Data

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCOPE of the SI

The rapid development of social networks dramatically changes the way people think, work, and interact. As more and more individual users proactively generate, share, and exchange digital contents through social media, social networks have become a key source of big data. However, with such vast interconnectivity, convergence of relationships, and shared user information comes increased security and privacy concerns in social big data. On one hand, users carelessly posting their personal information on social media which can easily have their privacy breached. On the other hand, malicious attackers may manipulate such information to make a profit.

There are two important security and privacy issues in social networks. The first is how to effectively utilize social data while protecting user privacy. The second is how to guarantee the authenticity of social data for an in-depth data analysis. Traditional security mechanisms and models tailored to small-scale or isomorphic data are inadequate to securing social big data which exhibit enormous volume and diverse formats. Therefore, how to develop scalable cryptographic algorithms/protocols and lightweight data mining/organization/optimization models to solve the security and privacy challenges becomes crucial for the successful application of social big data.
