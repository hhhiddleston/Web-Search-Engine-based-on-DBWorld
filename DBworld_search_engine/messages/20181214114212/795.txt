*** SIGCHI Student Travel Grant (SSTG) Program *** 

27th ACM International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation
and Personalization (ACM UMAP 2019)

Golden Bay Beach Hotel 5*, Larnaca, Cyprus, June 9-12, 2019

We are pleased to announce that the SIGCHI Student Travel Grant (SSTG)
program is offering support opportunities for students to attend UMAP 2019. 

This grant is for students who lack other support opportunities and whose
intention is to present their work at the conference, not just plan to attend
the conference.

The goal is to pre-approve students for grants before the conference
submission deadline, so if a student gets a submission accepted, the
student can count on having a grant awarded for travel to the conference.

More information about this program and the application process: 
https://sigchi.org/conferences/student-travel-grants/student-travel-grant/

Relevant deadline for UMAP 2019: November 1, 2018
(application will open in October)

Notification of pre-approval: November 15, 2018

Information on additional funding options for students will soon be available
on the UMAP 2019 web site.
