BigVis 2019 :: 2nd International Workshop on Big Data Visual Exploration and Analytics
  https://bigvis.imsi.athenarc.gr/bigvis2019
  EDBT/ICDT 2019, March 26, 2019, Lisbon, Portugal
   
Held in conjunction with the 22nd Intl. Conference on Extending Database Technology & 22nd Intl. Conference on Database Theory (EDBT/ICDT 2019) 

In the Big Data era, the growing availability of a variety of massive datasets presents challenges and opportunities to not only corporate data analysts but also others, such as research scientists, data journalists, policy makers, SMEs, and individual data enthusiasts datasets are typically: accessible in a raw format that are not being loaded or indexed in a database (e.g., plain text, json, rdf), dynamic, dirty and heterogeneous in nature. The level of difficulty in transforming a data-curious user into someone who can access and analyze that data is even more burdensome now for a great number of users with little or no support and expertise on the data processing part. The purpose of visual data exploration is to facilitate information perception and manipulation, knowledge extraction and inference by non-expert users. Interactive visualization, used in a variety of modern systems, provides users with intuitive means to interpret and explore the content of the data, identify interesting patterns, infer correlations and causalities, and supports sense-making activities that are not always possible with traditional data analysis techniques.

In the Big Data era, several challenges arise in the field of data visualization and analytics. First, the modern exploration and visualization systems should offer scalable data management techniques in order to efficiently handle billion objects datasets, limiting the system response in a few milliseconds. Besides, nowadays systems must address the challenge of on-the-fly scalable visualizations over large and dynamic sets of volatile raw data, offering efficient interactive exploration techniques, as well as mechanisms for information abstraction, sampling and summarization for addressing problems related to visual information overplotting. Further, they must encourage user comprehension offering customization capabilities to different user-defined exploration scenarios and preferences according to the analysis needs. Overall, the challenge is to enable users to gain value and insights out of the data as rapidly as possible, minimizing the role of IT-expert in the loop.

The BigVis workshop aims at addressing the above challenges and issues by providing a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss exchange and disseminate their work. BigVis attempts to attract attention from the research areas of Data Management & Mining, Information Visualization and Human-Computer Interaction and highlight novel works that bridge together these communities.



Workshop Topics 
-------------------------------
In the context of visual exploration and analytics, topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
 - Visualization and exploration techniques for various Big Data types (e.g., stream, spatial, high-dimensional, graph)
 - Human-centered database techniques
 - Indexes and data structures for data visualization
 - In situ visual exploration and analytics
 - Progressive visual analytics
 - Interactive caching and prefetching
 - Scalable visual operations (e.g., zooming, panning, linking, brushing)
 - Big Data visual representation techniques (e.g., aggregation, sampling, multi-level, filtering)
 - Setting-oriented visualization (e.g., display resolution/size, smart phones, pixel-oriented, visualization over networks)
 - User-oriented visualization (e.g., assistance, personalization, recommendation)
 - Visual analytics (e.g., pattern matching, timeseries analytics, prediction analysis, outlier detection, OLAP)
