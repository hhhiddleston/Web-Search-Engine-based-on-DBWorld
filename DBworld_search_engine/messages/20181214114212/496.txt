IUI 2019 Student Consortium Call for Papers

Overview
The IUI 2019 Student Consortium is intended to provide an opportunity for Doctoral and advanced Masters students to present and receive feedback about their research in an interdisciplinary workshop, under the guidance of a panel of mentors selected from senior people in the field. We invite students who feel they would benefit from this kind of feedback on their research to use this unique opportunity to share their work with students in a similar situation as well as senior researchers in the field. The consortium will be organized with 8 to 12 presentations by the students, whose applications have been selected by the Student Consortium chairs and potentially other reviewers. The strongest candidates will be those who have a clear topic and research approach, and have made some progress, but who are not so far along in their research that they can no longer make changes. The final version of accepted SC submissions will be included in the main conference proceedings published in the ACM DL.

Complimentary/reduced conference registration will be available for students. Student Consortium participants will also be given high priority when applying for the student travel awards. Moreover, we are working to provide partial reimbursement of travel/accommodation expenses specifically for the participants of the Student Consortium. More information will come soon.

Objectives
The objectives of the student consortium are to:
1- Serve as a supportive setting to provide/receive feedback on students' current doctoral and masters' research and guidance on future research directions
2- Offer each student comments and fresh perspectives on their work from researchers and students outside of their own institution
3- Promote the development of a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research
4- Contribute to the conference goals through interaction with other researchers and conference events
