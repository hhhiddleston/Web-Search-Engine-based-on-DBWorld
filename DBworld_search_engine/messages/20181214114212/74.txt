CALL FOR PAPERS 

About the Conference


LA-WEB 2019 is the 10th of a series of refereed international conferences that aim to provide a venue to present, demonstrate and discuss the latest advancements in Web research that involves the Latin American Web community in its broadest sense. LA-WEB offers a great venue to show exciting new work that is mature (full papers) and work that is at an early stage and can benefit from discussion with colleagues (short papers). In this edition, LA-WEB will be co-located with The Web Conference 2019. We expect that this creates an opportunity for a synergetic atmosphere between the Latin American community and the global community of leading Web researchers.


Themes and Topics of Interest


We invite submissions of papers that describe original, unpublished, high-quality research, properly placing the work in the context of the state of the art, and clearly indicating the workâ€™s innovative aspects and contributions to the field. 


We would like to welcome high-quality contributions along the following two lines:


1. Web research that focuses on Latin American problematics or on applications to the region.
2. Innovative Web developments by Latin American researchers worldwide or by Latin American institutions.


Overall, we seek novel and exciting work in all areas of Web research including, but not limited to the following: 


* Influence propagation, information diffusion, and online democracy
* Detecting, understanding, and combating disinformation and misinformation
* Fraud, spam, and malice detection
* Mitigation of abusive and discriminatory behavior
* E-commerce, E-Science, and E-government
* E-Learning and Moocs
* Humanities, arts, and culture on the Web
* Mobility and ubiquitous Web access in emerging regions
* Security, privacy, and rights management
* Social media, collaboration, and web communities
* Usability, accessibility and user interfaces
* User modeling, recommender systems and personalization
* Visualization and interaction
* Data mining, search, and analytics
* Engineering: Performance, reliability, and scalability
* Ethical issues
* Crisis informatics
* Fairness, bias, and transparency in algorithms

All submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, quality, and technical contribution. LA-WEB proceedings will be published jointly with The Web Conference proceedings.
