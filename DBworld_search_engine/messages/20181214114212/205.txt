======================

Dear colleagues,

The Computer Science department of Ecole Polytechnique considers
hiring full-time and part-time Assistant Professors and Professors in
2019.

Teaching will take place in the Bachelor program, in the IngÃ©nieur
Polytechnicien Program or in Master programs proposed by Ecole
Polytechnique.

For the full-time positions, the research activity will be carried out
at one of the research groups of LIX https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr,
the Computer Science Laboratory of Ecole Polytechnique. The applicants
are expected to have international scientific recognition, and
demonstrate excellent teaching skills. Mastery of the French language
is a plus, but is not essential.

We strongly encourage candidates to make contact with the research
groups at LIX before a potential interview with the selection
committee.

Precise positions will be advertised later at
(in French) http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Eric.Goubault/Postes2019.htm
(in English) http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Eric.Goubault/positions-2019.htm
where you will also find an outline of the curricula in Computer
Science at Ecole Polytechnique, as well as statutes and salaries for
professors at Ecole Polytechnique.

If you are interested to know more already, feel free to contact

Cheers,
Eric.
