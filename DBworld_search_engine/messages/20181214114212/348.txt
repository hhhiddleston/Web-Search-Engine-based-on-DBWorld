Call for Participants for a Five-Day Ideas Lab Focusing on 
the Challenge 

ÒDigital Health Meets Societal Needs Ð Transforming 
Health Systems into a Patient-Centred WorldÓ 

Closing date for applications: 20 December 2018 

 

1. Introduction 

The Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft (LBG) is an independent research institution with a 
major focus on the fields of medicine, life sciences, humanities and social sciences. With 
its 21 research units and approximately 550 employees, the LBG promotes academic 
excellence and world-class research with the aim of generating innovations for society. 
The LBG is convinced that innovation in research and science is also the result of 
openness, interdisciplinarity, internationality, and a clear focus on quality. Consequently, 
since 2014 the LBG has worked intensively on the topic of Open Innovation in Science 
and founded the Open Innovation in Science Centre. 

Open Innovation in Science (OIS) refers to opening up the entire scientific knowledge-
acquisition and innovation process Ð from the definition of the research question to the 
implementation of innovative solutions. This means that scientific methods are 
deliberately turned into open, collaborative, and participatory processes, with the clear 
ambition of creation something new and adding value for society. It is important to 
understand that the process used to set up the two new Ludwig Boltzmann Institutes for 
Digital Health will follow OIS principles. Moreover, these institutes themselves will follow 
OIS methods such as an active and deliberate focus on users (patients, family members, 
providers, etc.) and be required to include them in their scientific activities. The OIS 
approach can be described as strongly interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral and shall 
become manifest in a multifaceted composition of the research teams. This involves 
persons with creative and/or artistic backgrounds as well as representatives of patients 
and user groups. 

This describes the principles and institutional background of the Ludwig Boltzmann 
Gesellschaft for addressing the following research challenge: The increase in life 
expectancy is accompanied by the amplified occurrence of chronic diseases and 
comorbidities. Due to these factors, in ageing societies the demand for health services 
already exceeds the capacity of the system. However, restricted resources force the 
traditionally rigid healthcare system to explore opportunities in digitalisation and patient 
inclusion. This new era of health care brings new roles to the different players and 
stakeholders. To meet the expectation of citizens and Ð at the same time Ð to relieve the 
system, traditional hierarchies are challenged to create a level playing field for 
meaningful collaboration between patients and healthcare professionals and for the 
allocation of tasks and responsibilities. To achieve this, existing silos have to be abolished 
and a new ecosystem built that focusses on user-centred solutions and patient safety. 

 

 

 
Therefore, the LBG is establishing two separate, seven-year-funded, interdisciplinary 
Ludwig Boltzmann Institutes for Digital Health with an emphasis on: 

Increasing Patient Participation during Diagnosis, Acute and Life-Long Therapy 
(INSTITUTE 1 situated at the University Hospital Salzburg, Austria) 

Securing and Enhancing the Quality of Health Services and Patient Safety 
(INSTITUTE 2 situated at Medical University of Vienna, Austria) 

 

In order to facilitate the successful start of excellent research, the LBG hosts an 
interactive and free-thinking workshop event, called Ideas Lab. The aim of the Ideas 
Lab is to bring together a unique mix of expertise from various disciplines, to form 
research teams that produce high-quality research proposals. The emphasis will be on an 
interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral approach to foster new collaborations, to bring new 
thoughts from different perspectives to the problem and thus encourage innovative 
approaches to problem-solving. This highly innovative method will encourage the 
cooperative generation of new ideas and will open possibilities for completely new 
research constellations and boundary-spanning activities. 

 

During the Ideas Lab, a selected group of researchers and potential contributors with 
different complementary backgrounds, from a diverse range of disciplines and sectors, 
will come together to immerse themselves in an inspiring and collaborative thinking 
process. In the creative environment of the Ideas Lab, new innovative solutions will 
emerge to address defined research topics. Our aim is to enable researchers to perform 
research in a more interdisciplinary manner through OIS and, within the Ideas Lab, to 
develop novel approaches that will have a strong societal impact. 

 

It is expected that, in total, up to EUR 1.3 million (per year, over a period of seven 
years) will be available for each of the two Ludwig Boltzmann Institutes for Digital 
Health. From this Ideas Lab, a group of 3-4 Principal Investigators and 1-2 Co-
Investigators will be selected for each of the two institutes. The PI-positions are 
designated to take the lead in several research programme lines (research groups) within 
the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute, and they are expected to be strongly committed to their 
role; they will be offered a full-time employment contract by LBG. They will lead the 
research of the instituteÕs constituent research groups and are responsible for the 
recruitment of their further researcher staff. The Co-Investigators will be strongly 
committed to the institute and can receive funding (for parts of their own position, as 
well as for hiring an additional predoc researcher) while remaining employed at their 
current institution. Nonetheless, the Co-Investigators are expected to strongly engage 
with the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute through regular extended visits, online meetings, 
collaboration, etc. 

 

The Ludwig Boltzmann Institutes for Digital Health will be based at the University 
Hospital Salzburg (affiliated with Prof. Josef Niebauer, Institute 1) and at the Medical 
University of Vienna (affiliated with Prof. Harald Willschke, Institute 2). It is expected 
that the new interdisciplinary Ludwig Boltzmann Institutes will strongly connect to the 
Austrian and international scientific community and will work closely with key 
stakeholders such as patientsÕ organisations, professional associations, user crowds, etc. 

 

 

 

 
2. The Research Topics for the Ideas Lab on Digital Health 

The Ideas Lab will serve as a catalyst to help researchers from various disciplines 
generate research proposals within the scope of one of the following two specific research 
topics. 

2.1. Research Topic I 

How to support positive health behaviour for cardiovascular disease patients in 
a sustainable way? 

A big part of the entire cardiovascular disease burden of the population is related to a 
range of unhealthy behavioural risk factors (i.e. unhealthy dietary habits, smoking, 
physical inactivity). Whereas prevention and rehabilitation programmes lead to 
meaningful short-term effects, long-term effects are rather disappointing and thus 
patientsÕ health is not preserved in a sustainable manner. Mechanisms (i.e. motivation, 
incentives, etc.) behind healthy behaviour and ways in which digital tools can impact 
secondary prevention in a sustainable way have yet to be discovered. New ways are 
needed to involve patients in this process to increase the efficacy of intervention 
programmes. To this end, the healthcare system needs to be more open to increased 
involvement from the patientsÕ side. 

Core Research Questions associated with this research topic: 

Relevance to cardiovascular diseases 

¥ What are the basic links between health behaviour and cardiovascular 
diseases? 


Incentives for adherence to positive behaviour 

¥ How can novel, life-long treatment options (e.g. online coaching) be co-
designed to consider individual characteristics of real-life situations of 
patients to achieve sustainable health? 
¥ How can mechanism design (e.g. reverse game theory, persuasive 
design, gamification) be used to affect sustainable, healthy behaviour? 
¥ Which incentives support behavioural changes in a sustainable way? 
¥ How to use digital tools to find leverage points in the individual patientÕs 
situation to gain maximum improvement with the least effort? 
¥ How do we design effective media (digital tools and messaging) 
collaboratively to stimulate and sustain healthy behaviour? 
¥ How can the acceptance of preventive technologies by patients and 
healthcare professionals be increased to support patientsÕ self-
determination? 
¥ How to increase healthcare professionalsÕ adherence to supporting digital 
tools to alter behaviour? 


Effectiveness 

¥ How to quantify / measure the patient outcome in behavioural 
interventions? 
¥ How can self-generated patient data be collected and blended with 
official health records to provide a complete picture of patientsÕ health 
status for diagnosis, treatment and care? 
¥ How to reduce inequality (vulnerable groups and gender aspect) in 
patient and caregiver participation? 


 

 
2.2. Research Topic II 

How to provide digital solutions in health ecosystems, i.e. patients, families, 
and providers, to deal with patient-safety issues and health literacy in a patient-
centric way? 

People are becoming increasingly informed about their health. Nonetheless, in order to 
guarantee patient safety, healthcare professionals need to be trained to address 
uncertainty among patients and caregivers about complexity, probability, and ambiguity 
throughout the patient journey. Many of the preventable complications could be avoided 
using digital solutions to support caregivers and patients by monitoring and optimising 
treatment strategies in the patient journey. With more efficient knowledge transfer, 
patients and care givers can be empowered. This requires deep, two-way communication 
between healthcare professionals and patients, leading to shared and data-assisted 
decision-making. Additionally, this decision-making can be further supported by 
personalised recommendations from the available general data. To achieve this, 
traditional hierarchies have to be modified and patients need to take centre stage 
amongst the other stakeholders. 

Core Research Questions associated with this research topic: 

Empowering patients 

¥ What is the relationship between uncertainty and patient safety in a 
digital health environment? 
¥ How can the patient be guided through the digital system most 
efficiently? 
¥ How can digital tools be applied in such a way that interpersonal contact 
is not lost? 
¥ How can digitisation guarantee values for patients and caregivers 
(doctors, nurses, social workers, family members, friends)? 
¥ How to consider ethical aspects of digitisation and define patient safety 
from a patientÕs and caregiverÕs perspective? 


Empowering healthcare professionals 

¥ How to empower healthcare professionals to understand and 
communicate the impact of digital transformation with regard to clinical 
processes? 
¥ How to stimulate the engagement of healthcare professionals with the 
help of digitalisation to avoid preventable complications throughout the 
patient journey (intra-/extramural)? 
¥ How to develop tools and processes to enhance effective, two-way 
communication about uncertainty in a digital health environment? 


Assisting decision-making 

¥ How to support informed and shared decision-making around the patient 
journey in a digital health environment? 
¥ How can collected individual data support system learning on decision-
making? 
¥ How to translate general to personalised statistics for better patient 
outcomes? 


 

 
3. The Ideas Lab 

Participants from a diverse range of professional backgrounds are hereby invited to apply 
their knowledge, skills and experience across various areas to develop innovative 
research proposals with the potential to deliver practical solutions for the challenges 
posed. 

 

The broad aims of the Ideas Lab are to generate research concepts for the new 
Ludwig Boltzmann Institutes which can: 

 

¥ Address the identified key research questions. 
¥ Facilitate interaction among researchers, users, and patient groups. 
¥ Apply adequate Open Innovation in Science approaches for interaction and 
research. 
¥ Identify a common language among disciplines. 
¥ Build a better understanding of the problems and research challenges posed and 
allow these to be framed more clearly. 
¥ Introduce multi-disciplinary perspectives to problems, thus increasing the 
innovation potential of the research teams. 


 

The Ideas Lab will involve a maximum of 30 applicants as participants. It will be led by 
the director of the Ideas Lab, who chairs the Ideas Lab and will be supported by a team 
of mentors. These mentors are experts in the research areas concerned. The director and 
mentors encourage new ideas by asking questions, highlighting ideas that seem exciting, 
and making connections between participants as well as between emerging ideas. 
Furthermore, they will act as independent reviewers, making a funding recommendation 
on the research proposals emerging from the Ideas Lab. 

 

How will it work? 

The Ideas Lab will run over five days, starting late in the afternoon on Sunday, 17 
February 2019 and finishing late in the afternoon on Friday, 22 February 2019. The Ideas 
Lab can be broken down into several stages: 

¥ Defining the scope of the research topics 
¥ Identifying common languages and terminologies amongst people from a diverse 
range of backgrounds and disciplines 
¥ Sharing understanding of the research topics involved along with the expertise 
brought by the participants to the Ideas Lab 
¥ Taking part in break-out sessions focussing on the challenges, using creative 
thinking techniques 
¥ Capturing the output and forming highly innovative research concepts 
¥ Forming research teams consisting of Principal Investigators and Co-Investigators 
¥ Selecting research concepts using Òreal-timeÓ peer review as well as a validation 
check 


 

For applicants who will finally be invited to join the Ideas Lab, a preparatory and 
obligatory Open Innovation in Science webinar will be organised in order to increase 
awareness and knowledge of the expected inclusion of OIS approaches into the research 
concepts. 

 

Who is invited to apply? 

Invited to apply are researchers with post-doctoral or equivalent experience, as well as 
other qualified persons with different complementary backgrounds from a diverse range 
of disciplines and sectors, who feel that they can contribute to both topics, regardless of 
their disciplinary/professional background. Potential Principal Investigators and Co-
Investigators shall have been awarded their first doctor /PhD > 4 and ² 14 years prior to 

 
1 January 2019, i.e. doctorÕs degree/PhD awarded between 1 January 2005 and 31 
December 2014 or demonstrate their equivalent experience accordingly. 

Potential participants should indicate how their expertise can help address one or both of 
the defined research topics. 

As the Ideas Lab is based on an ethos of innovative collaboration, all applicants must 
demonstrate both enthusiasm and appropriate personal attributes for multidisciplinary 
collaborative research. Furthermore, the ability to develop and pursue new OIS 
approaches will also be a key criterion in selecting applicants. 

We emphasise that this Call is open to any discipline and sector but anticipate that it will 
be of particular interest to those working in the following areas: 

. Medicine and Health Sciences (Physicians, Allied Health Professionals (e.g. 
Nurses, Physiotherapists, Exercise Physiologists, Exercise Scientists), Public 
Health, Alternative Medicine, Genetics, Molecular Biology, Biochemistry,

able to give individual feedback to unsuccessful applicants. 

 

 

4. Post Ideas Lab Proposal Assessment 

Following the Ideas Lab, the research teams consisting of Principal Investigators and Co-
Investigators with the highest potential will be tasked to elaborate on their research 
concepts together with the host and partner institutions of the Ludwig Boltzmann 
Institutes for Digital Health and the LBG and develop them into 7-year research plans 
covering their intended activities as identified at the Ideas Lab as part of the funding 
application. 

The deadline for submission of an elaborated research plan is 15 April 2019. Further 
guidance on this part of the process will be available during the Ideas Lab event. 

 

The primary criteria used throughout the process of developing and assessing the final 
proposals will be how adequately proposals address the vision of the Call. We seek to 
support those that demonstrate: 

¥ Novel, highly multidisciplinary research plans, clearly reflecting the distinctive 
opportunity for creating such plans that the Ideas Lab provides. 
¥ Clear evidence that the research team has the capability to deliver their project as 
a high-quality multidisciplinary activity, provided both through the presentation of 
their joint proposal and their activity during the Ideas Lab. 
¥ Clear relevance to and the potential to make a distinctive and novel contribution 
towards addressing the research challenges in this area. 
¥ Readiness to include Open Innovation in Science approaches in the proposed 
research. 
¥ The feasibility of the project and its potential societal impact. 


 

 

It is planned that final funding decisions will be made by the end of April 2019. The
