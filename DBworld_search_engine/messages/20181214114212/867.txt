CALL FOR PAPERS
---------------
Following the successful series of events since 2014, the 5th International Workshop on Privacy and Security of Big Data (PSBD 2018) focuses the attention on privacy and security research issues in the context of Big Data, a vibrant and challenging research context which is playing a leading role in the Database research community. Indeed, while Big Data is gaining the attention from the research community, also driven by some relevant technological innovations (like Clouds) as well as novel paradigms (like social networks), the issues of privacy and security of Big Data represent a fundamental problem in this research context, due to the fact Big Data are typically published online for supporting knowledge management and fruition processes and, in addition to this, such data are usually handled by multiple owners, with possible secure multi-part computation issues. Some of the hot topics in the context privacy and security of Big Data include: (i) privacy and security of Big Data integration and exchange; (ii) privacy and security of Big Data in data-intensive Cloud computing; (iii) system architectures in support of privacy and security of Big Data, e.g., GPUs: (iv) privacy and security issues of Big Data querying and analysis.

The 5th International Workshop on Privacy and Security of Big Data (PSBD 2018) will be held in conjunction with the 2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData 2018 - http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2018/), in Seattle, WA, USA, during December 13, 2018, and it focuses on these aspects, by posing the emphasis on a theoretical as well as a practical point of view, and provides a forum for researchers and practitioners interested in privacy and security of big data to meet and exchange preliminary ideas and mature results.
