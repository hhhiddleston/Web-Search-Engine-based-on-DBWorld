Security and Communication Networks
Special Issue on Characterization and Detection of Fakes, Spammers,
and Bots in Social and Communication Networks

Deadline for submission: January 18, 2019
Publication date: June, 2019

This special issue focuses on authentication techniques, access
control mechanisms, network traffic analysis,
and novel detection techniques for malicious users/nodes in
social/communication networks.

Online social networks, and in general, communication networks, are a
crucial component in the public sphere, enhancing communications,
fostering discussions, and influencing the public perception for a
myriad of issues. However, social and communication networks have
become the ideal stage for the proliferation of fictitious and
malicious accounts, including bots and botnets. Efficient detection of
such malicious nodes in social and communication networks has thus
become one of the most pressing contemporary challenges. Particular
emphasis should be given to the design of flexible and scalable
techniques capable of dealing with different types of malicious nodes
in large-scale analyses. We also encourage studies assessing the
consequences of malicious actions. Finally, novel approaches to the
collection and annotation of large ground-truth datasets are also
welcomed.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to) the following:

- Authentication techniques to discriminate between legitimate and
malicious nodes
- Access control mechanisms that prevent data disclosure hosted in
social and communication networks to possible bots
- Machine learning-based detection techniques for malicious nodes
- Network analysis techniques for characterization and detection of
malicious nodes
- Online behavioral modeling for the detection of anomalous behaviors
- Techniques for detecting groups of synchronized and coordinated
malicious nodes
- Techniques for detecting evolving/evading malicious nodes
