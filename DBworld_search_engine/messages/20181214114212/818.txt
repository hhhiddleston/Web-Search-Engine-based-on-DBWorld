The 1st International Workshop on Large Scale Graph Data Analytics (LSGDA) in Conjunction with ICDE 2019

Website: https://lsgda.github.io/

Various application domains such as social networks, communication networks, collaboration networks, biological networks, transportation networks, knowledge networks naturally generate large scale graph data to capture the connectedness among entities. Driven by these applications, there is an increasing demand for the development of novel graph analytics models and scalable graph analytics techniques and systems. The 1st International Workshop on Large Scale Graph Data Analytics (LSGDA 2019) aims to provide a forum for researchers from academia and industry to exchange ideas, techniques and application scenarios in large scale graph data analytics as well as discuss open challenges and identify new research directions in the area. Besides regular research papers, we also welcome vision papers, demonstration papers and papers with industry showcase from various applications.

The workshop is co-located with the International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2019)

Topics of interest include but not limited to:
- Graph data model, storage, indexing and query processing techniques
- Graph mining techniques
- Techniques for distributed graph analytics
- Graph visualization techniques and system interfaces
- Dynamic and streaming graph data analytics
- Spatial-temporal graph analytics
- AI techniques for graphs
- Machine learning techniques for graphs
- Graph analytics in various application domains such as social networks multimedia, semantic web, biological data, business processes, transport data, etc.
- Vision papers to survey the area of graph data analytics as well as describe the future research directions
