SCOPE AND LIST OF TOPICS:

   Prologue:
   Cyber Warfare adds an additional dimension to warfare. Generally, it
   involves the battlespace use and targeting of computers and networks in
   warfare. Cyber Warfare strategies include both offensive and defensive
   operations pertaining to the threat of cyberattacks, espionage, sabotage,
   disruptions to infrastructures, theft of critical information, and
   publishing deliberate misinformation (fake news and fabricated news)
   spread via traditional media and online social media with the intend to
   mislead in order to disrupt the political processes of nations. The
   methods and technologies utilized in Cyber Warfare can be countered
   using Cyber Defense strategies. Cyber Defense strategies involve the
   heavy and targeted use of Cyber Security. Topics of interest include:

     - Cyber Warfare Technologies and Strategies

INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSION OF PAPERS FOR EVALUATION:

   All accepted papers will be published by IEEE CPS:
   https://www.computer.org/web/cs-cps/ 
   in the proceedings of The 2018 International Conference on
   Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI'18).

   Since its inception, CSCI proceedings has always been approved and
   included into IEEE Xplore indexation/digital-library/science citation
   index databases. IEEE Xplore: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ 

   Papers should be typeset by using the general typesetting
   instructions available at:
   https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html 
   (i.e., use of regular Times New Roman, font size of 10, single line
   spacing, 2-column format). Authors of accepted papers will later
   receive more specific typesetting instructions. All submissions must
   be original (papers must not have been previously published or
   currently being considered by others for publication).

   Submissions must be in either MS doc or pdf formats (6 pages for
   Regular Research Papers; 4 pages for Short Papers; 2 pages for
   Poster Papers - the number of pages include all figures, tables, and
   references). The first page should include:

   - Title of the paper.
   - Name, affiliation, city, country, and email address of each author
     (identify the name of the Contact Author).
   - Abstract (about 100 words).
   - A maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the work
     described in the paper (see the list of topics).
   - Write the type of the submission as "Full/Regular Research Papers",
     "Short Papers", or "Poster Papers".
   - Write "CSCI-ISCW"

   The actual paper can start from the first page (space permitting).
   Submissions are to be uploaded to the submission/evaluation web site
   portal at: https://american-cse.org/ 


TYPE OF SUBMISSIONS/PAPERS:

  - Full/Regular Research Papers (maximum of 6 pages):
    Regular Research Papers should provide detail original research
    contributions. They must report new research results that represent
    a contribution to the field; sufficient details and support for
    the results and conclusions should also be provided. The work
    presented in regular papers are expected to be at a stage of
    maturity that with some additional work can be published as journal
    papers.

  - Short Papers (maximum of 4 pages):
    Short papers report on ongoing research projects. They should provide
    overall research methodologies with some results. The work presented
    in short papers are expected to be at a stage of maturity that with
    some additional work can be published as regular papers.

  - Poster Papers (maximum of 2 pages):
    Poster papers report on ongoing research projects that are still in
    their infancy (i.e., at very early stages). Such papers tend to
    provide research methodologies without yet concrete results.


REVIEW PROCESS

   Each paper will be peer-reviewed by 2 to 4 peers (except for papers that
   are philosophical in nature - such papers would be considered for panel
   discussions.) Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained.
   Papers will be evaluated on the basis of originality, impact, significance,
   quality of research, quality of writing, and contribution to conference
   program and diversity. Papers whose authors include one or more members
   of the program committee will be evaluated using the double-blinded
   review process. Authors whose papers are not selected for publication
   can submit a rebuttal letter; rebuttals will be evaluated by 4 members
   of the Program Committee.
