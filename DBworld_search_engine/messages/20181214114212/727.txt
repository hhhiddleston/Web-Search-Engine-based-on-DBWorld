PODS 2019 - 38th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on 
PRINCIPLES OF DATABASE SYSTEMS

June 30 - July 05, 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands
https://sigmod2019.org


CALL FOR RESEARCH PAPERS (2nd Submission Cycle)


The Principles of Database Systems (PODS) symposium series, held in conjunction with the SIGMOD conference series, provides a premier annual forum for the communication of new advances in the theoretical foundations of data management, traditional or nontraditional (see https://databasetheory.org/PODS). 


TOPICS OF INTEREST

For the 38th edition, PODS continues to aim to broaden its scope, and calls for research papers providing original, substantial contributions along one or more of the following aspects: 
    - deep theoretical exploration of topical areas central to data management 
    - new formal frameworks that aim at providing a basis for deeper theoretical investigation of important emerging issues in data management 
    - validation of theoretical approaches from the lens of practical applicability in data management. Papers in this track should provide an experimental evaluation that gives new insight in established theories. Besides, they should provide a clear message to the database theory community as to which aspects need further (theoretical) investigation, based on the experimental findings.

Topics that fit the interests of the symposium include, but are not limited to: 
    - concurrency & recovery, distributed/parallel databases, cloud computing
    - data and knowledge integration and exchange, data provenance, views and data warehouses, metadata management
    - data-centric (business) process management, workflows, web services
    - data management and machine learning
    - data mining, information extraction, search
    - data models, data structures, algorithms for data management
    - data privacy and security, human-related data and ethics
    - data streams
    - design, semantics, query languages
    - domain-specific databases (multi-media, scientific, spatial, temporal, text)
    - graph databases and (semantic) Web data
    - incompleteness, inconsistency, uncertainty in data management
    - knowledge-enriched data management
    - model theory, logics, algebras, computational complexity


SUBMISSION FORMAT

Submitted papers must be formatted using the standard ACM proceedings stylesheet (https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). Submitted papers should be at most twelve pages, including bibliography. Additional details may be included in an appendix that should be incorporated at the submission time (online appendices are not allowed). However, such appendices will be read at the discretion of the program committee. Papers that are longer than twelve pages (including bibliography but excluding the appendix) or do not cohere with the ACM proceedings style risk rejection without consideration of their merits. PODS 2019 specifically encourages the submission of shorter papers as well as papers that make use of the full page allowance. The submission process will be through the Web at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2019. Note that PODS does not use double-blind reviewing, and therefore PODS submissions should have the names and affiliations of authors listed on the paper. 

The results of submitted paper must be unpublished and not submitted elsewhere, including the formal proceedings of other symposia or workshops. Authors of an accepted paper will be expected to sign copyright release forms, and one author is expected to present it at the conference.
