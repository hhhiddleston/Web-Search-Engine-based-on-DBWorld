Chiang Mai is considered as a top travel destination. With rich cultural background and natural beauty, the city welcomes more than 15 million visitors a year. Visitors can enjoy cultural attractions within the city area, such as historic places or temples, by walking or bicycling. On the other hands, a day trip to nearby national parks or other natural activities such as elephant riding or ziplining are also very popular among travellers.
