CALL FOR PAPERS 
 

SITIS 2018 – The 14 th IEEE - International Conference on SIGNAL IMAGE TECHNOLOGY & 
INTERNET BASED SYSTEMS Track on 
Intelligent Web Computing and Applications (I-WeCA)
Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain, November 26-29, 2018
http://www.sitis-conf.org/

The I-WeCA (Intelligent Web Computing and Applications) track of the 14th international IEEE SITIS conference will focus on emerging concepts, architectures, protocols, and methodologies for both information management on the Web and the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that connect unlimited numbers of smart objects to make our environment more interactive. In such an interconnected world, information can be exchanged easily, tasks can be processed collaboratively, devices and objects can be intelligently connected, communities of users with similar interests can be formed to achieve their goals efficiently and improve performance. Taking full advantage of these interconnected environments and available Web information as well to meet the ever increasing needs of emerging applications requires solutions that address new issues and challenges. Novel architectures and solutions are being proposed promoting the dawn of the Internet of Things – or so called Intelligent Web – era, ranging over enhanced and semantic-aware machine-to-machine communications, resource sharing and processing of linked data and devices, distributed computing and cooperative systems, mobile information systems and services, semantic-based applications and intelligent data processing, as well as enhanced data security and privacy protocols, etc., to state a few examples.  

The aim of this Intelligent Web computing and Applications (I-WeCA) track is to provide an international forum for researchers, professionals, and industrial practitioners to share their experiences and knowledge in this growing and highly important area of internet and Web technologies.

The topics of interest of the track include, but are not limited to:
