Tenured associate professor position in data science, University of Caen Normandie

Data science, based on the availability of increasingly rich data, its manipulation,
and particularly its exploitation for economic and scientific purposes, is undergoing
continuous evolution. Based on an original combination of data mining, constraint 
programming, and usage of graphs, the CoDaG research group of the CNRS-affiliated GREYC
laboratory conducts internationally recognized innovative work on these topics and 
their application to domains such as chemoinformatics. 
The group is involved in a number of projects, collaborates with different national 
and international research groups, and takes an active role in animating research at
the national level. It is in this context that GREYC is recruiting an associate professor,
who will acquire tenure after a one-year trial period, to reinforce its research activities 
on the above-mentioned topics, starting the position in September 2019. She or he is 
expected to take on new challenges such as optimization-driven data mining, construction
of result summaries, or the application of symbolic methods to explain results and models 
derived from numerical methods.
 
The scientific profile of the candidates should be strongly anchored in at least one of
the following areas: constraint programming, SAT, optimization, data mining, or graph-based
mining and learning. The main research area will be the application of constraint resolution,
optimization, and data mining methods to data-based decision support.
 
The recruited person should demonstrate the desire to interact and exchange with people from
other research and/or application domains (such as chemoinformatics, biological data, sports
data, textual data) and the drive and experience to mount new collaborations and projects.
The quality of the research and publication record will be an important element in the 
recruitment process.

Teaching is expected to occur at the bachelor and master level, covering general as well as 
specialty topics. Candidates should therefore also show a solid teaching profile, and a solid 
general knowledge in computer science. Teaching is done almost exclusively in *French*.

Interested candidates are encouraged to contact Bruno CrÃ©milleux (bruno.cremilleux@unicaen.fr),
or Albrecht Zimmermann (albrecht.zimmermann@unicaen.fr), in particular because French recruiting
passes via a centralized service that has *strict* deadlines.
