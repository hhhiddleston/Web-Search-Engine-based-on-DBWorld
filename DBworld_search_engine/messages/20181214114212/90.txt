Location: Pittsburgh, PA
Term: 1 year (with possibility of renewal)
Application deadline: Open until filled
Start date: flexible, but preference is given to a start in January 2019. 

We seek two postdocs in computational social science with strong interest, quantitative skills and expertise in utilizing text and network data to understand collective behavior and group biases. 

We consider a wide variety of disciplinary backgrounds, including computational social science, computer science (with expertise in machine learning, natural language processing, etc.), computational linguistics, social psychology, sociology, political science, and applied mathematics. The postdocs will work with Yu-Ru Lin and Rebecca Hwa. They would be housed at the Pitt Computational Social Dynamic (PICSO) Lab. The research project aims to advance research methodology in revealing biases of different groups or cultures by analyzing social media data with cutting-edge methods of natural language processing and statistical learning. Compensation will be competitive. 

Particular priorities for hiring are:  (1) experience in machine learning, natural language processing (deep learning, distributed semantic representation, text mining methods), and/or qualitative and mixed-methods approaches; (2) demonstrated the capability to work with text data, especially social media data. 

Candidates should submit the following materials electronically to Dr. Yu-Ru Lin at . Please include "PostDoc Application 2019" in the email subject line.
