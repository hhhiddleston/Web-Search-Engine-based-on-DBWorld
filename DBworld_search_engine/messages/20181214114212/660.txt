SACLA 2019,
the 48th Annual Conference of the Southern African Computer Lecturers' Association, 
provides a forum for the presentation and discussion of original research and 
practical experiences in tertiary-level "teaching and learning" of "Computing"
in its variety of related disciplines, (e.g. Computer Science, Informatics,
Data Science, Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, Information Systems, 
etc.) including also the science-philosophical foundations thereof.

The conference programme will include full papers, short and discussion papers, 
panels/workshops, plenary keynote addresses, and demonstrations of innovative tools 
from researchers and industrial partners. 

The conference theme for 2019 is "Computing Matters of Course!" 
In line with this theme, we call for submissions from anywhere in the world
focussing on practical experiences and successes in computing education at 
tertiary level, especially in the following 
topic areas:
* Classroom innovation, and assessment of the impact thereof
* Novel tools developed, or novel use of existing tools, for learning and/or assessment 
* Research undertaken to investigate aspects of computing education

The intention is to help others become better computing lecturers.

Venue.
The conference will take place in the beautiful "Alpine Heath" (Bergville area) 
in South Africa's Northern Drakensberg mountains, offside the hectic noise 
of the big cities; see https://www.aha.co.za/alpine-heath-resort/

* FULL PAPERS (maximum of 16 pages in LNCS Layout) 
  that report on completed research, inclusive of results. 
* SHORT PAPERS (maximum of 8 pages in LNCS Layout) 
  that report on works in progress with significant intermediate results.
* DISCUSSION PAPERS ABSTRACTS (maximum of 3 pages in size A4, 12pt "Times Roman" font)

Important Dates.
- The deadline for paper submission is 28 February 2019, with notification of paper acceptance 10 April 2019.

Review.
- Full paper submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of an international programme committee, following a double-blind peer review process. 
- Submitted papers will be evaluated according to their "match" with the themes of the conference, novel research contribution, methodological soundness, coverage of relevant related work, quality of analysis, and quality of writing and presentation style.
- Only unpublished research papers in English will be considered. 
- In cases of doubt papers may possibly be scanned for originality by using checker-tools such.
- Short papers and discussion paper abstracts will be evaluated, too, however not in a 'double-blind' mode.

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference; (no publication without presentation).

Publications.
- It is planned that a fine selection of the conference's best papers shall appear as post-proceedings in Springer's Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) series. CCIS is abstracted/indexed in DBLP, Google Scholar, EI-Compendex, Mathematical Reviews, SCImago, and Scopus. CCIS volumes are also submitted for the inclusion in ISI Proceedings. See, for example, the SACLA`2017 post-proceedings publications at https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319696690. 
- Full papers not selected for the Springer publication will be included in the SACLA`2019 on-line proceedings, to be made available (with ISBN) on the SACLA`2019 web site. 
- Full papers not accepted for either the CCIS volume or the SACLA 2019 on-line proceedings may be reworked to a short or discussion paper. All accepted short papers (author agreement required) will be included in 'Addendum A' in the SACLA 2019 on-line proceedings. 
- Accepted discussion paper abstracts will be included (author agreement required) in 'Addendum B' in the SACLA 2019 on-line proceedings. 

Author Guidelines.
- All papers must follow the CCIS template, which is located on the Springer website at http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines
- Authors should guarantee the anonymity of their submissions by removing names and affiliations from the first page and elsewhere in the paper that would allow reviewers to easily identify authors.
- All papers must be submitted via Easy Chair at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sacla2019 (opens 1 November 2018).
