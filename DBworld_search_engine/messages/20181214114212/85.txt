NEDBDay will be an all day conference-style event where participants from the research community and industry in the Northeast region of the US can come together to present ideas and discuss their research and experiences. This includes talks throughout the day, keynotes, as well as a poster session in the late afternoon.

We are soliciting papers/talks as well as posters. For the former, please prepare a maximum 2 page abstract (in the format of your choosing) describing research you would like to present in a talk. For posters, please prepare a maximum 1 page abstract summarizing your poster (a paragraph is actually fine). All reasonable posters will be accepted.
