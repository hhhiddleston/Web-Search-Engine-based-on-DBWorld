WORKSHOP
The Seventh Workshop on Scalable Cloud Data Management is co-located with the IEEE International Conference on Big Data 2018 and tackles the manifold new topics in the area of cloud data management. The workshop is focused on new research challenges for scalable databases and data processing in the context of cloud computing.

MOTIVATION
The increasing adoption of cloud computing for databases and data services introduces a variety of new research challenges.  To leverage elastic cloud resources, scalability has to be a fundamental architectural design trait of these new cloud databases. This challenge has manifested in new data models (â€œNoSQLâ€), replication, caching and partitioning schemes, relaxed consistency and transaction guarantees as well as new protocols, APIs, and storage services. This workshop invites submissions about new technologies enabling databases for cloud environments and offering them as services (Database-as-a-Service). We solicit research on novel database designs and their distribution and storage mechanisms as well as scalable data and data-processing services. The application side of cloud databases is equally important, as it might impose new programming models, APIs, and web-enabled interfaces. We are convinced that bringing together cloud computing, service design and data architectures in this workshop will contribute to this exciting new field.

TOPICS OF INTEREST
The topics of this workshop include, but are not limited to:
-Database as a Service, Multi-tenancy
-Machine Learning Methods for Data Management
-Elasticity and Scalability for Cloud Data Management Systems
-New Protocols, Service Interfaces and Data Models for Cloud Databases
-Polyglot Persistence, NoSQL, Schemaless Data Modeling, Integration
-Data-Centric Web-Services, RESTful Data Services
-Database Architectures for Mobile and Web Clients
-Content Delivery Networks, Caching, Load-Balancing, Web-scale workloads
-Virtualization for Cloud Databases, Storage Structures, and Indexing
-Frameworks and Systems for Parallel and Distributed Computing
-Scalable Machine Learning, Analytics, and Data Science
-Resource and Workload Management in Cloud Databases
-Tunable and Eventual Consistency, Latency
-High Availability, Reliability, Failover
-Transactional Models for Cloud Databases
-Query Languages and Processing, Programming Models
-Consistency, Replication, and Partitioning
-CAP, Data Structures, and Algorithms for Eventually Consistent Stores
