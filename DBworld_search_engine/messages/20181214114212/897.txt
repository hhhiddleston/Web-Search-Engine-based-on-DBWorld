Blockchain is fast emerging as a disruptive technology solution in the areas involving 
multiple stakeholders, each having complex business processes implemented in unique 
systems and infrastructure; operating in different administrative, geopolitical boundaries. 
With cross-organizational workflows and complex compliance requirements, industry sectors 
like Healthcare, Finance, Manufacturing, International Trade, Insurance, Retail, 
Supply Chain, Recruitment, Media, Real-estate, and Education etc. can benefit significantly
 by improved operational efficiency, enhanced security, and transparency offered by 
blockchain implementation.  


Though rapid adaptation, blockchain technology practices, standardizations and research 
activities are in its nascent stages and evolving continuously with new tools, technologies, 
approaches and application strategies. In this scenario an aims of the proposed workshop is to: 

Offer a platform for the community to identify, discuss and collaborate on some of the 
central research and application avenues of the blockchain technology landscape. 
Help participants in developing familiarity with relevant theoretical concepts, tools,
implementation strategies and current practices in the area.
