1st Call for Papers:
The 15th European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA 2019)
co-located with STAF 2019,
July 15-19 2019,
Eindhoven, the Netherlands
https://staf2019.win.tue.nl/events/ecmfa19/
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

TL;NR: call for high-quality foundation and application papers to be presented at ECMFA 2019 in Eindhoven (July 15-19, 2019), and published as gold open access journal publication in the The Journal of Object Technology (JOT). You may also consider the new junior researcher community track and the research project showcase, both also part of the STAF 2019 event.

About the conference
---------------------------

The 15th European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA) is dedicated to advancing the state of knowledge and fostering the application of Model-Based Engineering (MBE) and related approaches. Its focus is on engaging the key figures of research and industry in a dialog which will result in stronger and more effective practical application of MBE, hence producing more reliable software based on state-of-the-art research results.

---------------------------
Topics
---------------------------

ECMFAâ€™19 has two distinct kinds of papers: one for research papers dealing with the modelling foundations, and one for research papers dealing with the applications of modelling techniques, including experience reports on model-based engineering tools, industrial use, case studies, etc.

In the Foundation track, we are soliciting papers presenting original research on all aspects of model-based engineering. Foundation papers will be evaluated based on their suitability for the conference, originality, and technical soundness. They require novel and complete research work supported by adequate evaluation results. Typical topics of interest include, among others:

- Foundations of (Meta)modelling
- Domain Specific Modelling Languages and Language Workbenches
- Model Reasoning, Testing, and Validation
- Model Transformation, Code Generation and Reverse Engineering
- Model Execution and Simulation
- Model Management aspects such as (Co-)Evolution, Consistency, Synchronization, Differencing, and Versioning
- Model-Based Engineering Environments and Tool Chains
- Foundations of Requirements Modelling, Architecture Modelling, Platform Modelling
- Foundations of Quality Aspects and Modelling non-functional System Properties
- Scalability of MBE techniques
- Collaborative modelling

In the Application track, we solicit papers representing viewpoints, innovations, and practical experiences in employing Model-Based Engineering (MBE) from all aspects, e.g., modelling foundations, methods, approaches, and tools. We are also seeking experience reports, empirical evaluations, or case studies on the applications, successes, or failures of MBE. Papers from both researchers and practitioners are welcomed in this track. Topics of interest include, but not limited are:

- MBE for Critical Systems (Safety, Mission, ..)
- MBE for Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems and Internet of Things
- Model-Based Security Engineering
- MBE for Software and Business Process Modelling
- MBE Applications in Transportation, Health Care, Cloud&Mobile computing...
- Model-Based Integration and Simulation
- Model-Based Testing
- Model-Based System Analysis
- Application of Modelling Standards
- Comparative Studies of MBE Methods and Tools
- Metrics for MBE Development
- MBE Training
- Practical Experiences of applying MBE

---------------------------
Submission and Publication
---------------------------

Submissions must conform to the Journal of Object Technology (JOT) LaTeX template (http://www.jot.fm/templates/jot-latex-template.tar.gz) (manuscript processed with MS Word should produce a similar format), and must not exceed 20 pages (including figures, references, and appendices). All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee. The reviewers will assess the completeness, the quality of and the relevance of the submission.

All papers have to be submitted electronically in PDF format through this Easychair link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecmfa2019

All accepted papers will be published as gold open-access journal publication in the Journal of Object Technology (JOT). At least one author for each accepted paper must register before the early registration deadline and present the paper during the conference. Failure to do so will result in the paper being withdrawn from the proceedings.
