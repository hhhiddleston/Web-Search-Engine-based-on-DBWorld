CALL FOR PAPERS 

2019 IEEE Conference on Cognitive and Computational Aspects of Situation Management (CogSIMA 2019)
8-11 April 2019, Luxor Hotel, Las Vegas, NV, USA

http://www.cogsima2019.org

Sponsored by the IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society

------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEFINITION AND SCOPE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where Cognitive Science meets Computer Science

The CogSIMA conference series provides an annual venue for presenting multi-disciplinary research on complex heterogeneous dynamical systems - of interacting humans, machines, computer agents and/or networks - whose individual and/or collective behavior depends on their Situation Awareness.

Examples of systems include a variety of command and control systems, disaster monitoring and recovery systems, human-robot teams, physical and cyber security situation awareness systems, intelligent transportation systems, health care medical situation control systems, and many other systems.

The CogSIMA conferences are aimed at researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and government, with a wide variety of backgrounds and experience including computer science, artificial intelligence, human factors, cognitive science, modeling & simulation, robotics, and systems engineering.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPICS OF INTEREST
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Cognitive and computational foundations of situation awareness, situation control, decision making, and belief management
* Metaphysical studies of concepts and modeling of situations, context, events, goals, intentions, actions, and, behavior
* Situation sensing, perception, comprehension, prediction and truth maintenance
* "Big Data" analysis, (multi-modal) situation learning (e.g., from text, images, video) and situation knowledge acquisition
* Social media processing for situation awareness
* Cognitive information fusion
* Integration of human and signal intelligence
* Multi-agent situation awareness, situation control and decision support
* Models of collaboration and emergent behavior in cognitive multi-agent systems
* Situation recognition in autonomous vehicles (e.g., UAVs, self-driving cars)
* Situation assessment in Reinforcement Learning
* Biologically-inspired computational models of situation management
* Approaches to spatial and temporal reasoning, reasoning about goals, intentions and actions
* Metrics and evaluation of performance of hybrid human-machine systems
* Models of human-machine collaboration, hybrid and distributed cognition, situation understanding of cognitive agents and virtual assistants
* Ontology-based computing
* Context modeling and discovery
* Systems, platforms and tools for situation awareness, situation control and decision support
* System-level experiments
* Application-specific research

SUBMISSIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two types of paper submissions will be accepted:

Regular Papers (5-7 pages): Papers that describe new results that advance the state-of-the-art
Poster Presentations (3-5 pages): Papers that describe work in progress

Quantitative and/or qualitative methods and results are welcome, as well as hypotheses-driven or more open-ended exploratory work. Submissions must clearly outline the methodology (manipulations, measurements, environment and context, etc.) and technologies used, for both replicability and enabling in-depth review.

In addition, research providing novel system designs, algorithms, interface technologies, and computational methods supporting elements of situation management are encouraged. It is assumed that the submitted papers address the issues related to the general domain of situation management.

All papers must present original and unpublished work that is not currently under review elsewhere.
Each paper will be reviewed by at least three independent referees. Papers will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, and relevance to the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to attend the conference.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO SUBMIT
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Authors should prepare a Portable Document Format (PDF) version of their full paper in 2-column style (main text in 10-point size) including figures and correct margins. Please use the stylesheet templates provided by IEEE to assure that your proposal is in line with our guidelines. Authors of accepted papers will need to sign an IEEE copyright release form and present their paper at the conference. The conference proceedings will be submitted to the IEEE Xplore® digital library. All paper submissions will be handled electronically by EDAS.
For more information contact admin@cogsima.org.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
DUE DATES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regular Papers and Poster Papers: December 23, 2018
Acceptance Notification: February 8, 2019
Camera Ready due: February 21, 2019

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PUBLICATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The conference proceedings will be electronically published in the IEEE CogSIMA Conference Proceedings and will be submitted to the IEEE Xplore® digital library. At least one author of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the full (member or non-member) rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC grants permission for a substitute presenter arranged in advance of the event and who is qualified both to present and answer questions. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final IEEE formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. For authors with multiple accepted papers, one full registration is valid for up to 3 papers.
