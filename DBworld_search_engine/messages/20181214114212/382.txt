Bidirectional transformations (bx) are a mechanism for maintaining the consistency of at least two related sources of information. Such sources can be relational databases, software models and code, or any other document following standard or ad-hoc formats. Bx are an emerging topic in a wide range of research areas, with prominent presence at top conferences in several different fields (namely databases, programming languages, software engineering, and graph transformation), but with results in one field often getting limited exposure in the others. Bx 2019 is a dedicated venue for bx in all relevant fields, and is part of a workshop series that was created in order to promote cross-disciplinary research and awareness in the area. As such, since its beginning in 2012, the workshop has rotated between venues in different fields.


Important Dates
===============

- Abstract submission: 12 Feb 2019 (AoE)
- Paper submission:    19 Feb 2019 (AoE)
- Author notification:  8 Apr 2019
- Camera-ready version: around 1 May 2019
- Workshop: some day during 3â€“7 June 2019


Aims and Topics
===============

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners, established and new, interested in bx from different perspectives, including but not limited to:

- bidirectional programming languages and frameworks
- data and model synchronization
- view updating
- inter-model consistency analysis and repair
- data/schema (or model/metamodel) co-evolution
- coupled software/model transformations
- inversion of transformations and data exchange mappings
- domain-specific languages for bx
- analysis and classification of requirements for bx
- bridging the gap between formal concepts and application scenarios
- analysis of efficiency of transformation algorithms and benchmarks
- survey and comparison of bx technologies
- case studies and tool support


Submission Guidelines
=====================

Papers must follow the CEUR one-column style available at

http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/samplestyles/

and must be submitted via EasyChair:

https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bx2019

Five categories of submissions are considered:

* Full Research Papers (up to 15 pages)
- in-depth presentations of novel concepts and results
- applications of bx to new domains
- survey papers providing novel comparisons between existing bx technologies and approaches case studies

* Tool Papers (up to 8 pages)
- guideline papers presenting best practices for employing a specific bx approach (with a specific tool)
- presentation of new tools or substantial improvements to existing ones
- qualitative and/or quantitative comparisons of applying different bx approaches and tools

* Experience Report (up to 8 pages)
- sharing experiences and lessons learned with bx tools/frameworks/languages
- how bx is used in (research/industrial/educational) projects

* Extended Abstracts (up to 4 pages)
- work in progress
- small focused contributions
- position papers and research perspectives
- critical questions and challenges for bx

* Talk Proposals (up to 2 pages)
- proposed lectures about topics of interest for bx
- existing work representing relevant contributions for bx
- promising contributions that are not mature enough to be proposed as papers of the other categories

The bibliography is excluded from the page limits. All papers are expected to be self-contained and well-written. Tool papers are not expected to present novel scientific results, but to document artifacts of interest and share bx experience/best practices with the community. Experience papers are expected to report on lessons learnt from applying bx approaches, languages, tools, and theories to practical application case studies. Extended abstracts should primarily provoke interesting discussion at the workshop and will not be held to the same standard of maturity as regular papers. Talk proposals are expected to present work that is of particular interest to the community and worth a talk slot at the workshop.

We strongly encourage authors to ensure that any (variants of) examples are present in the bx example repository at the time of submission, and for tool papers, to allow for reproducibility with minimal effort, either via a virtual machine (e.g., via Share - http://share20.eu) or a dedicated website with relevant artifacts and tool access.

All papers will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the programme committee.

If a paper is accepted, one author of the paper is expected to participate in the workshop to present it. Authors of accepted tool papers are also expected to be available to demonstrate their tool at the event.


Proceedings and Special Issue
=============================

The workshop proceedings, including all accepted papers (except talk proposals), will be published electronically by CEUR (http://ceur-ws.org). A special issue open to all authors of papers in BX workshops over the past few years is planned.
