The Database Group at the School of Informatics, University of
Edinburgh, is recruiting three post-doctoral researchers. The
positions are open to database researchers with a promising
publication record who have a PhD, or are close to completing their
PhD, in computer science or closely related field.  

The post is in connection with an EPSRC programme grant "VADA: Value
Added Data Systems" that combines database teams from Edinburgh,
Oxford, and Manchester. The current focus of the database group in
Edinburgh is on formal semantics of query languages for relational and
graph databases, developing languages for graph databases, handling
incomplete data, and querying inconsistent databases. We are looking
for researchers with both theory and systems building skills.

These full-time posts are available from 1 December 2018 for one year
(with a possibility of extension).
