â€‹====
Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) was founded in 2009 as the fourth National Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea. Since its opening, UNIST has truly become one of worldâ€™s leading science and technology universities, despite being younger than its peers.
The School of Management Engineering was established in 2016 based to counter a lack of related skills in the metropolitan city of Ulsan, the hub of Korean industry, where more than one million people are living. The school offers undergraduate, MSc, and PhD programs.
