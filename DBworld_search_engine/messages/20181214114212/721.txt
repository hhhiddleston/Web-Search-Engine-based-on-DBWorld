SCOPE AND LIST OF TOPICS:

   Prologue:
   Health Informatics and Medical Systems is an important area that is at
   the intersection of information science, computer science, social
   science, behavioral science and health care. This field is mainly
   concerned with the resources, devices, and methods required to optimize
   the acquisition, storage, retrieval, processing and use of information
   in health and biomedicine. Health informatics is driven by computers,
   information and communication systems. It is a multi-disciplinary field
   that covers a wide spectrum of sub-fields. It combines the problem
   solving skills of computer scientists with health care professionals and
   health care givers. The list of topics of interest that appears below is
   by no means exhaustive:

   - Information Technologies for Healthcare Delivery and Management;
   - Health Data Acquisition, Management and Visualization;
   - Healthcare Knowledge Management and Decision Support;
   - Healthcare Modeling and Simulation;
   - Data Analytics, Data Mining and Machine Learning;
   - Health Information Systems;
   - Clinical Informatics;
   - Integrated Data Repository;
   - Computational Health Informatics;
   - Community Health Informatics;
   - Informatics for Education & Research in Health and Medicine;
   - Imaging Science;
   - Collaboration tools such as social media, web apps, patient education;
   - Healthcare Communication Networks and Environments;
   - Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals;
   - Computer-Aided Surgery;
   - Computers in Medical Education;
   - Haptics in Healthcare;
   - Health Care Information Systems;
   - Implant Technology and Systems;
   - Interactive 3-D Models;
   - Medical Physics;
   - Neural, Sensory Systems and Rehabilitation;
   - Patient Diagnosis Methods;
   - Patient Monitoring Systems;
   - Regenerative Medicine;
   - Systems Physiology;
   - Telemedicine;
   - Therapeutic Engineering and Systems.

INVITATION:

   You are invited to submit a paper for consideration. All accepted papers
   will be published by IEEE CPS (refer to ieeexplore.ieee.org for previous
   years' IEEE Xplore inclusion) in the proceedings of The 2018 International
   Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI).
   Extended versions of selected papers of the conference will also appear
   in journals and edited research books (Springer, Elsevier, BMC, ...) The
   published proceedings can be accessed via IEEE CPS and other Digital
   libraries.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSION OF PAPERS FOR EVALUATION:

   All accepted papers will be published by IEEE CPS:
   https://www.computer.org/web/cs-cps/ 
   in the proceedings of The 2018 International Conference on
   Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI'18).

   Past CSCI proceedings are indexed into IEEE Xplore Digital Library
   and can be accessed via:
   Volume I (2014):  https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6822065 
   Volume II (2014): https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6822285

   Volume (2016):    https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7879541 
   Volume (2017):    Pending/soon (within days)

   Papers should be typeset by using the general typesetting
   instructions available at:
   https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html 
   (i.e., use of regular Times New Roman, font size of 10, single line
   spacing, 2-column format). Authors of accepted papers will later
   receive more specific typesetting instructions. All submissions must
   be original (papers must not have been previously published or
   currently being considered by others for publication).

   Submissions must be in either MS doc or pdf formats (6 pages for
   Regular Research Papers; 4 pages for Short Papers; 2 pages for
   Poster Papers - the number of pages include all figures, tables, and
   references). The first page should include:

   - Title of the paper.
   - Name, affiliation, city, country, and email address of each author
     (identify the name of the Contact Author).
   - Abstract (about 100 words).
   - A maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the work
     described in the paper (see the list of topics).
   - Write the type of the submission as "Full/Regular Research Papers",
     "Short Papers", or "Poster Papers".
   - Write "CSCI-ISHI"

   The actual paper can start from the first page (space permitting).
   Submissions are to be uploaded to the submission/evaluation web site
   portal at: https://american-cse.org/ 


TYPE OF SUBMISSIONS/PAPERS:

  - Full/Regular Research Papers (maximum of 6 pages):
    Regular Research Papers should provide detail original research
    contributions. They must report new research results that represent
    a contribution to the field; sufficient details and support for
    the results and conclusions should also be provided. The work
    presented in regular papers are expected to be at a stage of
    maturity that with some additional work can be published as journal
    papers.

  - Short Papers (maximum of 4 pages):
    Short papers report on ongoing research projects. They should provide
    overall research methodologies with some results. The work presented
    in short papers are expected to be at a stage of maturity that with
    some additional work can be published as regular papers.

  - Poster Papers (maximum of 2 pages):
    Poster papers report on ongoing research projects that are still in
    their infancy (i.e., at very early stages). Such papers tend to
    provide research methodologies without yet concrete results.


REVIEW PROCESS

   Each paper will be peer-reviewed by 2 to 4 peers (except for papers that
   are philosophical in nature - such papers would be considered for panel
   discussions.) Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained.
   Papers will be evaluated on the basis of originality, impact, significance,
   quality of research, quality of writing, and contribution to conference
   program and diversity. Papers whose authors include one or more members
   of the program committee will be evaluated using the double-blinded
   review process. Authors whose papers are not selected for publication
   can submit a rebuttal letter; rebuttals will be evaluated by 4 members
   of the Program Committee.
