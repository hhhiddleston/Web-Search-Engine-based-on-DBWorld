CfP: Workshop on Fog Computing and the Internet of Things (Fog-IoT 2019), co-located with CPS-IoT Week 2019
https://sites.google.com/iotcenter.dk/fog-iot

When cyber-physical systems become interconnected with each other and with the Internet, they are called the Internet of Things (IoT), forming "the infrastructure of the information society". Fog Computing is a "system-level architecture that distributes resources and services of computing, storage, control and net-working anywhere along the continuum from Cloud to Things"  and is about to tremendously impact the IoT. The Fog-IoT 2019 workshop will be co-located with CPS-IoT Week 2019, taking place in Montreal, Canada, April 15-18, 2019. The workshop itself takes place on April 15th.

###SUBMISSION###
The material must be unpublished and not under submission elsewhere. Submissions will be accepted based on their originality, quality, significance, and relevance. Position papers and review papers are welcome, as long as they contain original material. The papers will be published in IEEE Xplore, unless the authors notify the organizers that they prefer not to include their paper in IEEE Xplore. The paper PDF will be linked in the program website, but it will not be considered a formal publication. Please submit your paper via the submission page https://sites.google.com/iotcenter.dk/fog-iot/submission

By submitting a paper, the authors confirm that if the paper is accepted, at least one author will register for the workshop by the  registration deadline set in the notification of acceptance, and present the paper at the workshop in person. Extended versions of the accepted papers may be invited to special issues in a journal.

The main body of each submitted paper is limited to 4 pages of technical content with additional pages permitted for the bibliography and acknowledgments only (i.e., references and acknowledgements do not count against the page limit).  Submissions must be formatted according to IEEE conference paper guidelines (10pt font, default margins, default line spacing). Please use one of the available IEEE conference templates https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html.
