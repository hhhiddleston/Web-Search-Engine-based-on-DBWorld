CALL FOR PAPERS

The organizing committee is delighted to invite paper submissions for the 3rd IEEE International Conference on Fog and Edge Computing (ICFEC), that will be held as part of IEEE/ACM CCGrid 2019, which is sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).


The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is incorporating "things" from the physical world into the Internet environment to enhance the monitoring and intelligent control of physical, digital and social systems. Such things include smart infrastructures like power grids with sensing and actuation capabilities, mobile platforms like smart phones and vehicles, and consumer electronic and appliances such as refrigerators and healthcare devices. In cloud-centric IoT applications, the observational streams from these things at the edge of the network are extracted, accumulated and processed centrally at public/private clouds, and the responses are communicated back to the things, leading to significant latencies and bandwidth costs.

To satisfy the ever increasing demand for computing resources from emerging applications such as IoT, academics and industry experts are now advocating to supplement large cloud data centers with micro data centres. These micro data centres, also called Fogs, are located at the edge of the network, closer to a user (in the spatial and/or network topology) than cloud data centres. Further, edge devices such as smart phones and gateways themselves have non-trivial compute capacity and are even closer to the user. As a result, it is possible to utilize such edge and fog resources to off-load computation that would traditionally have been carried out at the cloud.

Referred to as "Fog/Edge computing", this paradigm is expected to improve the agility of cloud service deployments, make use of opportunistic and cheap computing, and leverage the network latency and bandwidth diversities between these resources. On the one hand, the development of fog and edge computing infrastructure requires examining operating systems, virtualization and containers, and middleware techniques for fabric management. On the other hand, the use of fog and edge computing paradigm requires extensions to current programming models and development of new abstractions that will allow developers to design novel applications that can benefit from such massively distributed systems. This also opens up other challenges in: security, privacy and trust of the edge and fog resources; resource management for mobile, transient and constrained resources; distributed data, state and context management; and emerging domains like autonomous vehicles and deep learning over such platforms.

 IoT gateways and hubs: architecture, performance, deployment
 Performance models for integration IoT & Cloud systems
 Data centers and infrastructures for Fog/Edge Computing
 Middleware for IoT, Fog/Edge infrastructures
 Scheduling for IoT, Fog/Edge resources
 Storage and metadata management for Fog/Edge Computing
 Monitoring/metering of IoT, Fog/Edge infrastructures
 Real-time, locality-sensitive and mission-critical applications
 Legal and management/governance issues
 Security, privacy and trust
 Modelling and simulation environments


Important Dates
---------------
Papers due: November 30, 2018
Notifications of Acceptance: February 1, 2019
Camera Ready Paper: February 15, 2019

Registration will be aligned with CCGRID Deadlines: http://www.ccgrid2019.org 


Submission Guidelines
---------------------
Authors are invited to submit papers electronically in PDF format for peer-review. Submitted papers must represent original unpublished research that is currently not under review at any other conference or journal. All manuscripts will be reviewed and judged on technical strength, originality, significance, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference attendees. The official language of the conference is English.

Submitted manuscripts should be structured as technical papers and may not exceed 10 letter-size (8.5" x 11") pages including all figures, tables and references using the IEEE format for conference proceedings. See IEEE's publishing website for LaTeX and MS Word templates: http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html

Submissions not conforming to these guidelines may be returned without review.

The online portal for paper submission is at: https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icfec2019


Publication
-----------
Proceedings will be published through the IEEE Computer Society Conference Publishing Services. Paper submitted could be accepted as REGULAR paper (10 pages) or SHORT papers (6 pages), depending on the reviewer recommendations.


Special Issue
-------------
Authors of highly rated papers from ICFEC 2019 will be invited to submit an extended version to a special issue that we expect to appear with the Journal of Software: Practice and Experience (SPE) published by Wiley Press.
