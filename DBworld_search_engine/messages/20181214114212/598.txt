Final submissions due: 01 February 2019

Publication issue: November/December 2019

Please email Guest Editors Fred Douglis (Perspecta Labs) and Jason
Nieh (Columbia University) a brief description of the article you plan
to submit by 15 January 2019. Contact them at ic6-2019@computer.org.

Microservices, which allow an application to be comprised of many
independently operating and scalable components, have become a common
service paradigm. The ability to construct an application by
provisioning these interoperating components has various advantages,
including the isolation and independent development of tools such as
key-value stores, authentication, logging, and many others.

Containers are one type of system infrastructure that is commonly used
to support microservices. With container management systems like
Docker and orchestration systems like Kubernetes to control
applications and dynamically provision their resources, cloud services
can be extremely scalable, reliable, and reactive. However, other
systems beyond containers can be used to support microservices, and
many applications others than microservices benefit from
containerization.

This special issue of IEEE Internet Computing focuses on microservices
and containers. Articles that emphasize one but not the other are in
scope, but those that consider both of these important technologies
will receive extra consideration. Topics of interest include, but are
not limited to, the following, but always in the context of the theme
of the issue. (For example, a paper about Internet of Things but not
microservices or containers would be in scope for IC in general, but
out of scope for the special issue.)

+ Cloud, Edge, and Fog computing
+ Container platforms, such as Docker
+ Containers versus Virtual Machines
+ Embedded systems
+ Internet of Things
+ Migration
+ Network Function Virtualization
+ New advances, such as new containerization platforms
+ Orchestration, such as Kubernetes
+ Performance and Scalability
+ Preconfigured services
+ Security and Privacy
+ Serverless computing
+ Software delivery
+ System management
+ Testing

Submission Guidelines

All submissions must be original manuscripts of fewer than 5,000
words, focused on Internet technologies and implementations. All
manuscripts are subject to peer review on both technical merit and
relevance to IEEE Internet Computing international readership:
primarily, practicing engineers and academics who are looking for
material that introduces new technology and broadens familiarity with
current topics. We do not accept white papers, and papers which are
primarily theoretical or mathematical must clearly relate the
mathematical content to a real-life or engineering application.

Manuscripts must be submitted to ScholarOne by the deadline in order
to be considered for publication. Submissions are subject to peer
review on both technical merit and relevance to IEEE Internet
Computing readership.  See
https://publications.computer.org/internet-computing/2018/08/14/microservices-containers-call-papers/
for the online CFP with further links.

Articles should be understandable by a broad audience of computer
science and engineering professionals, avoiding a focus on theory,
mathematics, jargon, and abstract concepts. Accepted papers will be
lightly edited for grammar and formatting. Once an article is accepted
for publication, its content must placed into our magazine template
and uploaded into the IEEE Computer Society's Editorial Management
System. Figures and tables should be placed in the appropriate
location within the template, ideally in files that are 300 dpi or
higher at the dimensions they are used in the document template.
