Dear Colleague,

We would like to cordially invite you to submit a paper for IWINAC 2019 Special Session on Machine Learning Methods applied to Big Data Analysis, Processing and Visualization (MLBDAPV):

https://www.dtic.ua.es/~jgarcia/IWINAC2019/

Almeria, Spain - 3-7 June, 2019 (http://www.iwinac.org/iwinac2019/)

Aims:

The amount of data available every day is not only enormous, but growing at an exponential rate. Over the last years there has been an increasing interest in using machine learning methods to analyse and visualize massive data generated from very different sources and with many different features: social networks, surveillance systems, smart cities, medical diagnosis, business, cyberphysical systems or media digital data. This special session is designed to serve researchers and developers to publish original, innovative and state-of-the art machine learning algorithms and architectures to analyse and visualize large amounts of data.

This special session provides a platform for academics, developers, and industry-related researchers belonging to the vast communities of *Big Data*, *Machine Learning*, *Pattern Recognition*, *Visualization*,*Media Digital Data*, and many others, to discuss, share experience and explore traditional and new areas of Data analysis, processing or visualization and machine learning combined to solve a range of problems. The objective of the workshop is to integrate the growing international community of researchers working on the application of Machine Learning applied to Big Data analysis, processing and visualization to a fruitful discussion on the evolution and the benefits of this technology to the society.

The topics of interest are those related with big data, but we are particularly interested in candidates who have conducted research in the theoretical or practical aspects of big data – algorithms, machine learning, deep learning, statistical learning methods applied to one or more domains – software engineering, media digital data, bio-informatics, health care, imaging and video, social networks, natural language processing and others. It can be identified by, but are not limited to, the following subjects:

    Healthcare and medical diagnosis
    Social network modelling
    Financial risk assessment
    Marketing and E-commerce
    Multimedia data mining
    Visual surveillance
    Application Systems for Big Visual Data Understanding

    Approximate and randomized methods for subspace learning, classification and clustering on Big Data
    Nonlinear learning techniques             
    Distributed solutions for nonlinear big data processing and analysis
    Deep methods for representation learning, clustering and classification on Big Data
    Unsupervised and semi-supervised methods for Big Data
    Data-driven techniques for representation learning, clustering and classification on Big Data
    Big media data on the web and social networks
    Big multimedia data (signal, 2D/3D image, video) analysis in medicine, science and engineering
    Semantic visual analysis: human activity recognition, face/facial expression recognition, scene understanding, object detection and tracking, saliency detection
    Big Media Data applications, including media data summarization, post-processing, search and retrieval, video surveillance, robotics
    Big Media Data description, visualization and analytics
    Big cross-media analytics
