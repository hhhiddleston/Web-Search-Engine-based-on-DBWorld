The Department of Industrial Engineering & Innovation Sciences of the Eindhoven University of Technology has a vacancy for an: 
>> Assistant Professor (1,0 fte) in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics in Healthcare 

Preferred starting date: As soon as possible

======
The department of Industrial Engineering & Innovation Sciences (IE&IS) engages in education and research in the area of operational business processes and transitions in societies in relation to technical changes. In the IE&IS department, scholars and students work together on critical problems at the interface of engineering, management, innovation, and human behavior. The department has two schools: the School of Industrial Engineering and the School of Innovation Sciences. 

The School of Industrial Engineering is one of the leading IE schools in Europe, with a strong presence in the international research and education community. Within the School of Industrial Engineering five degree programs are taught: BSc in Industrial Engineering & Management Science, MSc in Operations Management & Logistics, MSc in Innovation Management, PDEng in Industrial Engineering and PhD in Operations, Logistics and Innovation Management. The research in the school is strongly connected to the Brainport area, the high-tech industrial area around the city of Eindhoven.

The Information Systems group performs research and teaches in business information systems, focusing on automated support of operational business processes within and between organizations. Research aims at design methods, analysis tools, information system architectures, data mining and intelligent systems development using advanced prototypes. The research approach is model-centric and engineering-oriented, integrating basic and applied research with contemporary real-world cases. Main application domains are the services industry, healthcare, logistics and supply chains. The research of the group is organized in an open, topic-oriented, dynamic cluster structure. The group operates in a strong international research and industry network, in which it participates in multiple European projects and organizes international conferences and workshops.

Job description
The assistant professor will initiate, perform and supervise high-quality research in the area of artificial intelligence and data analytics in healthcare, with a special focus on non-probabilistic uncertainty modelling (e.g. fuzzy systems, belief theory), computational intelligence and (deep) learning algorithms; teach courses in Bachelor and Master Programmes of the School of Industrial Engineering; contribute to externally funded research projects of the group; assist in the supervision of Ph.D. students and contribute to the management of the group. The candidate will become a member of the Information Systems group of the School of Industrial Engineering.

The assistant professor of Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics in Healthcare specialises in adaptive computerized systems and computational models for decisions regarding healthcare business processes. These models are typically developed with the help of various computational modelling techniques (e.g. from artificial or computational intelligence) and simulation. Such techniques are studied both from a theoretical perspective as well as from an applied perspective as far as they contribute to improved decision making within the context of healthcare processes. The assistant professor is able to integrate insights from theory and industrial practice and has an engineering approach to problem solving. 

======
Requirements
The candidate is expected to have the following qualifications:
  â€¢ A PhD degree in a relevant field such as computer science, computational intelligence, intelligent systems or a related quantitative field;
  â€¢ Published in international journals and conference proceedings of high quality;
  â€¢ Excellent communication, organization and management skills;
  â€¢ Strong cooperation skills and ability to work in a team;
  â€¢ Experience in teaching academic courses (preferably in information systems, business intelligence and computational intelligence).
  â€¢ Excellent mastering of the English language, good communication and leadership skills. Note that there is not a Dutch language requirement.

======
We offer:
  â€¢ a challenging job in a dynamic and ambitious university;
  â€¢ a tenure track appointment for a period of five years; a tenure evaluation will be conducted after three to four years. 
  â€¢ a gross monthly full time salary of an assistant professor between â‚¬ 3.545 and â‚¬ 5513 based on a fulltime employment and depending on experience and knowledge;
  â€¢ enrolment into a program to acquire an official teaching certification from Dutch Universities (Basic Teaching Qualification);
  â€¢ a yearly holiday allowance of 8% of the yearly salary;
  â€¢ a yearly end year allowance of 8.3% of the yearly salary;
  â€¢ a broad, attractive package of fringe benefits (including an excellent technical infrastructure, child care, savings schemes, and excellent sports facilities).

We are also open to application by candidates with some years of experience as assistant professor.
