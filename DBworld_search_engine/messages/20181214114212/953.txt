The high volume of information in organisations has led researchers to focus on knowledge management as a form of competitive leverage. Knowledge management (KM) aims to retrieve and share information within databases, documents and the know-how of employees to help cooperation and the improvement of ideas, increasing opportunities for innovation, and thus enabling organisations to better stay ahead of the competition.
Many organisations are implementing technologies and tools to better manage their knowledge. Successful examples can be found in private and public organisations from different sectors: industry, services, healthcare and education.
Interest in KM for the educational domain has been growing in recent years. This can be seen in many series of conferences and workshops, such as Educational Knowledge Management (EKM), International Educational Data Mining (EDM) and International Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK), as well as in papers discussing the role of knowledge management in higher education. As education is increasingly occurring online or using educational software, a larger amount of data is being generated and is available for analysis. New technologies such as semantic web and data mining techniques are being developed and tested, aiming for instance to improve educational effectiveness, determine the key factors for the success of educational training, support basic research on learning, or manage educational training by satisfying the needs of community, local industry or professional development.
For this special issue, we welcome submissions reporting original research that explores how KM technologies can solve problems related to the management and analysis of educational information in schools, colleges, universities and other academic or professional learning institutions. We solicit papers focusing on how these technologies can face the current evolution of educational systems, especially the mobility of students/teachers involved in interactive learning, the improvement of student retention and graduation rates, the analysis of the importance of social media and games in learning, the production of exam questions from text files, and so on.
