CALL FOR PAPERS - IEEE PerCom 2019
IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications

Kyoto, Japan, March 11-15 2019
http://www.percom.org

IEEE PerCom, now in its seventeenth year, is established as the premier annual scholarly venue in the areas of pervasive computing and communications. Pervasive computing and communications have evolved into highly active areas of research; they have found their way into many current commercial systems due to the tremendous advances in a broad spectrum of technologies and topics including wireless networking, mobile and distributed computing, sensor systems, ambient intelligence, and smart devices.

PerCom 2019 will be held in Kyoto, formerly the imperial capital of Japan for long years and one of the most attractive cities for tourists for its cultures, histories and cuisines. PerCom 2019 will provide a leading edge scholarly forum for researchers, engineers, and students alike to share their state-of-the art research and developmental work in the broad areas of pervasive computing and communications. The conference will feature a diverse mixture of interactive forums: core technical sessions of high-quality cutting-edge research articles; targeted workshops on exciting topics; live demonstrations of pervasive computing in action; insightful keynote speeches; panel discussions from domain experts; and posters of emerging ideas.

Research contributions are solicited in all areas pertinent to pervasive computing and communications, including:

- Advances in pervasive systems and infrastructures

middleware systems and services; large-scale data management for pervasive computing; 
clouds, cloudlets, and fog computing; device-to-device coordination; Internet of Things; 
sensor and actuator networks; experiences from real-world deployments.

- Theoretical and analytical models and algorithms

context modelling and reasoning; adaptive and context-aware computing; activity recognition; 
programming paradigms; applied machine learning; cognitive computing techniques.

- Domain-specific challenges and novel applications pervasive technologies for healthcare, sport, smart homes and buildings, smart manufacturing 
(Industry 4.0), smart cities; innovative pervasive computing applications in such domains.

- Intersections of pervasive computing and communications with other research areas social networks; urban/mobile crowd sensing & intelligence; opportunistic networks; big data.

- New techniques for user-level concerns

participatory and social sensing; trust, security, and privacy; user interfaces, interaction, 
and persuasion; blockchain and smart contracts.

- Technological innovations

architectures, protocols, and technologies for pervasive communications; mobile and wearable 
computing systems and services; smart devices and intelligent environments; cognitive and 
reconfigurable hardware; positioning and tracking technologies.
