A 1-year full-time postdoctoral position, in Italian "assegnista di ricerca" (AR), is available for a researcher in the area intersecting semantic technologies and machine learning. The goal of the project is to develop and implement machine learning algorithms for learning schemas over knowledge graphs (KGs) and then to develop and implement reasoning algorithms that validate such schemas against KGs. The results are going be evaluated against the real-world industrial problem on knowledge graph construction in collaboration with our industrial partners. 

The preferred candidate posses a doctoral degree (or be close to completion) in computer science or a related area, together with a documented track record of published, peer-reviewed research in related area. But generally, we  consider all applicants with a degree in Computer Science or a related area. 

As usual, the position holder will be expected to collaborate in the preparation of research papers, development and analysis of new algorithms, present papers at conferences, act as a source of information and advice to other members of the group on scientific procedures and experimental techniques, which will focus on machine learning, semantic technologies, and computational logic.

The closing date for applications is the 7th of January 2019.

The Free University of Bozen-Bolzano was founded in 1997 as a free, state-recognized university. Most of the teaching and research staff have an international professional background. Recently the university has appeared in top positions in various rankings of academic excellence. Situated in the north of Italy, Bolzano hosts different cultures and languages, mainly Italian, German, and Ladin. It is surrounded by the wonderful Dolomites mountain range, declared UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2009. Bolzano is ranked among the first Italian cities in terms of quality of life.

Interested candidates are invited to contact the PI of the project: Dr.Ognjen Savkovic (ognjen.savkovic@unibz.it) for any questions.
