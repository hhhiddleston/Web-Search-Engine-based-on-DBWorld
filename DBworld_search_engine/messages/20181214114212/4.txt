If you are working on a data science related research project, then I encourage you to submit a poster proposal to the 2019 Southern Data Science Conference (SDSC). Here are the details:

SDSC 2019
Poster Proposal Submission Deadline: Jan 24, 2019
https://www.southerndatascience.com/submission-guidline

Recent already published work can be presented. There is no double submission policy. Poster presenters will be required to attend the Poster Session at a specified time to discuss the work with conference attendees. The poster session will allow the presenter to interact with interested parties in a casual setting to share information and ideas. Selected poster presenters will receive FREE conference admission for the first (student) author!

If you have any questions or concerns about the submissions, please contact Prof. Petra Kralj Novak  or Prof. Jennifer Priestley .

The conference itself is April 11-12, 2019 in Atlanta, GA.
