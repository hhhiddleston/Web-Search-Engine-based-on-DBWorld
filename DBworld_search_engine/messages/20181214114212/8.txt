OVERVIEW
In the last few years, the use of Information and Communication Technologies has made
available a huge amount of heterogeneous data in various real application domains.
For example, in the urban scenario Internet of Things (IoT) systems capture massive
data collections describing the overall urban environment as well citizen exploitation
and perception of available services. In health care systems, electronic health records
allow storing a variety of information about patients as adopted treatments and monitored
physiological conditions, while Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) ensures the availability
and processing of healthcare data through smart medical devices and web. Moreover, in most
domains, individual plays a crucial role generating data on the one side, but also driving
a user and context aware analysis process, and finally demanding an easily accessible and
understandable knowledge at the end of the process.

Digging deep these data collections can unearth a rich spectrum of knowledge in the targeted
domain valuable to characterize user behaviours, identify weaknesses and strengths, improve
the quality of provided services or even devise new ones. However, data analytics on these
data collections is still a daunting task, because they are generally too big and heterogeneous
to be processed through data analysis techniques currently available. Consequently, various
challenges about data science arise dealing with creation, storage, search, sharing, modelling,
analysis, and visualization of data, information, and knowledge.

Suitable data fusion techniques and data representation paradigms should be devised to integrate
the heterogeneous collected data into a unified representation describing all facets of the
targeted domain. Moreover, huge volume of data demands the definition of novel data analytics
strategies also exploiting recent analysis paradigms and cloud based platforms as Hadoop and
Spark. Proper strategies can also be devised for data and knowledge visualization, possibly
also involving user interactive interfaces.

The aim of the workshop is to allow academics and practitioners from various research areas to
share their experiences on designing cutting-edge analytics solutions for real-life applications.
Researchers are encouraged to submit their work-in-progress research activity describing innovative
methodologies, algorithms, platforms addressing all facets of a data analytics process providing
interesting and useful services.

Industrial implementations of data analytics applications, design and deployment experience
reports on various issues raising data analytics projects are particularly welcome. We call
for research and experience papers as well as demonstration proposals covering any aspect of
data analytics solutions for real-life applications.
