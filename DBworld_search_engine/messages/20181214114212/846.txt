Data science is rapidly growing field and as a profession incorporates a wide variety of areas from statistics, mathematics and machine learning to applied big data analytics. In this regard, we put special interest and focus on data science in our past executions of CICIS conference. This year, in its 5th run, we decided to dedicate the conference to data science area and accordingly keep it as professional data science event in the future. The 5th international conference on Contemporary issues in Data Science (CiDaS) will provide a sort of a real workshop (not listen-shop) to scientists and scholars to share ideas, initiate future collaborations and brainstorm challenges as well as industries to catch emerging solutions from the science to their real data science problems.

Goal:Ê
CiDaS aims at providing first class brainstorming and collaboration potentials to data scientists and experts from other related areas and disciplines, who use data science innovations in their field. We accept applied and fundamental research papers, survey papers that show innovations in the fieldÊÊas well as papers from other disciplines that show novel application of data science and big data in their field such as healthcare, manufacturing, finance and etc.Ê

Keynote Speakers:Ê
- Soeren Auer: Leibniz University of Hannover, TIB Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology, Germany
