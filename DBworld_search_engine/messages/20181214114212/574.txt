Dear Friends.

We are delighted to announce a new, one hundred twenty-eight dataset archive of time series datasets [a].

The archive contains many interesting datasets, including a gesture dataset featuring the same two actors, but recorded 16 years apart! (we are nothing if not patient!).

The datasets are mostly designed for testing classification and clustering algorithms, but we are sure that the creative community will find other uses for it.

The archive is accompanied by a paper. Beyond explaining this resource, this paper offers pragmatic advice to anyone who may wish to evaluate a new algorithm on the archive. In addition, the paper makes a novel and actionable claim: of the hundreds of papers that show an improvement over the standard baseline (1-Nearest Neighbor classification), a large fraction may be misattributing the reasons for their improvement). 

The archive is current in Beta. We welcome feedback. 

Best wishes

The UCR Team
