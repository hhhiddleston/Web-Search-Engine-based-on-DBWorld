DaMoN'19, the 15th International Workshop on Data Management on New
Hardware, will take place in Amsterdam on 1 July, 2019.   DaMoN is
co-located with the ACM SIGMOD conference.

The aim of this one-day workshop is to bring together researchers who
are interested in optimizing database performance on modern computing
infrastructure by designing new data management techniques and tools.

CALL FOR PAPERS:

We invite submissions for two tracks:

1) Full papers: A full paper should be no more than 6 pages, inclusive
of all material except citations. There is no limit on the length of
the citations. Full papers describe a complete work in the area of
data management for new hardware. Accepted papers will be given 10
pages (plus citations) for the camera ready version and a 20-25 minute
presentation slot (including Q&A) during the workshop.

2) Short Papers: Short papers should not exceed two pages, excluding
citations. Short papers describe very early stage works or summaries
of mature systems. Short papers will be advertised with a "lightning"
talk as well as included in the proceedings.

All accepted papers (full and short) will also be presented as posters
at the workshop.

In addition, a selection of papers may be invited to submit an
extended version to the VLDB Journal.  Extended papers that are
accepted by VLDBJ will appear in a special "Best of DaMoN 2019"
section within one of the regular VLDBJ issues.

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers
that are not being considered for publication in any other
forum. Manuscripts should be submitted electronically as PDF files
using the latest ACM paper format (2017) to the DaMoN'19 CMT
site, which should be open for submissions early in 2019.
 
IMPORTANT DATES (planned):

Paper submission: 22 March 2019
Notification of acceptance: 19 April 2019
Camera-ready copies: 17 May 2019
Workshop: Monday, 1 July 2019

TOPICS OF INTEREST:

The continued evolution of computing hardware and infrastructure
imposes new challenges and bottlenecks to program performance. As a
result, traditional database architectures that focus solely on I/O
optimization increasingly fail to utilize hardware resources
efficiently.

Multi-core CPUs, GPUs, new memory and storage technologies (such as
flash and phase change memory), and low-power hardware impose a great
challenge to optimizing database performance. Consequently, exploiting
the characteristics of modern hardware has become an important topic
of database systems research.

The goal is to make database systems adapt automatically to the
sophisticated hardware characteristics, thus maximizing performance
transparently to applications. To achieve this goal, the data
management community needs interdisciplinary collaboration with
computer architecture, compiler, operating systems, and storage
researchers. This involves rethinking traditional data structures,
query processing algorithms, and database software architectures to
adapt to the advances in the underlying hardware infrastructure.

We seek submissions bridging the area of database systems to computer
architecture, compilers, and operating systems. In particular,
submissions covering topics from the following non-exclusive list are
encouraged:

* database algorithms and data structures on modern hardware
* cost models and query optimization for novel hierarchical memory systems
* hardware systems for query processing
* data management using co-processors
* novel application of new storage technologies to data management
* query processing using computing power in storage systems
* database architectures for low-power computing and embedded devices
* database architectures on multi-threaded and chip multiprocessors
* performance analysis of database workloads on modern hardware
* compiler and operating systems advances to improve database performance
* new benchmarks for micro-architectural evaluation of database workloads
