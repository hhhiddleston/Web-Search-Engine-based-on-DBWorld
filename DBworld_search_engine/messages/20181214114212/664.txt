Special Issue Information


Maritime transportation is the major conduit of international trade. In terms of cost, maritime transport is very competitive relative to land and airborne transport, increasing only by a few percent the total product cost. On the other hand, maritime transportation takes longer or may cause harbor congestion, which further increases voyage times. Furthermore, there are difficulties in integrating this transportation mode efficiently with other transport or distribution options. On top of that, the safety and the environmental impact of maritime transportation, in particular, in the case of sea accidents, are always two challenging issues. 
 
As recent advances on maritime transportation require the synergy of both computer science and maritime science, the main focus in this special issue will be upon the latest developments on IT methodologies for maritime transportation. Computational intelligence, data mining and knowledge discovery/representation, risk assessment methodologies as well as combinatorial optimization are the IT fields that have gain importance in maritime studies because of their potential in giving solutions for effective sea transportation.

Submissions are solicited in, but not limited to, the following areas:

- Graph and Network algorithms for Marine Transportation

- Combinatorial optimization techniques for Marine Transportation

- Weather Routing

- Environmentally Safe Shipping

- Safety and Security of Maritime Shipping

- Risk and Safety Analysis, Assessment and Prediction

- Piracy Protection

- GIS in Maritime Applications

- Spatiotemporal and Marine Data Handling

- Route Planning and Monitoring

- Maritime Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Applications: surveillance, maritime traffic control, anomaly detection, emergency management, situation recognition, etc. 

- Decision Support Tools for Marine Transportation

- Integration of Heterogeneous Marine Data Sources
