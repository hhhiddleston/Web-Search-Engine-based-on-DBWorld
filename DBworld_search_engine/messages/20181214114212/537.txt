17th International Business Process Management Conference (BPM 2019)
Vienna, September 1-6, 2019
https://bpm2019.ai.wu.ac.at/

== CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS ==

BPM 2019 is the 17th conference in a series that provides the most prestigious forum for researchers and practitioners in the field of Business Process Management (BPM). The conference has a record of attracting innovative research of highest quality related to all aspects of business process management, including theories, frameworks, methods, techniques, architectures, and empirical findings. BPM 2019 will take place in Vienna, Austria.

BPM 2019 is soliciting proposals for one-day or half-day workshops to be held before the main conference. Workshops facilitate the exchange of ideas and experiences among active researchers and stimulate discussions on new and emerging perspectives in line with the conference topics. Workshops may focus on specific research topics or be devoted to applications or standardization issues. Workshop proposals covering broad topics and that expand the scope of topics and paradigms traditionally represented at the BPM conference series are encouraged.

All workshop papers will be published by Springer as a post-workshop proceedings volume in the series Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing (LNBIP). These proceedings will be made available to all registered participants approximately four months after the workshops, while preliminary proceedings will be distributed during the workshop.

Different criteria will be considered by the workshop chairs for deciding whether or not a proposal is accepted. The workshop proposers should have a strong affinity with the proposed workshop topic and be well connected with experts on that topic. The workshop itself should provide a forum for important, innovative and timely BPM subtopics. Furthermore, we encourage the workshop proposers to integrate mechanisms in their workshop to stimulate discussion and interaction beyond what is possible in a plenary conference session. Beyond these aspects, the workshop chairs will ensure that the accepted workshops as a whole cover a broad spectrum of the BPM research discipline. To this end, there will be a negotiation phase in which we seek to consolidate and mark off promising workshop proposals that show overlap. The final decision on the acceptance format of a workshop will be made by the general workshop chairs considering the aforementioned criteria and the overall impression of the proposal.
