The candidate will participate to the extension of a data science platform dedicated to enhance the quality of healthcare data. The first step concerns prototyping a library of user-defined functions and machine-learning based algorithms for computing data quality indicators and their integration into this platform for real-world healthcare applications. The second step is to extend a query langage (SPARQL or SQL) to query data with declaring constraints on their quality. The work will be carried out in the context of QualiHealth, a multi-partner project recently funded by ANR (the French Agency for Research) and the creation of the new line of research initiatives in Data Science and AI at LIS Lab.

* The main missions are:
(i) Research on user-defined functions for data quality profiling of healthcare data;
(ii) Designing learning algorithms to discover data quality rules;
(iii) Prototyping and testing the query language extension for  declaring, manipulating and learning data quality indicators and quality constraints;
(iv) Integration and interfacing with the platform.

* Required Profile:
â—¦ PhD in Computer Science 
â—¦ Experience in machine learning and complex data analysis and/or data management
â—¦ Programming skills in Python
â—¦ Skills on big-data platforms (Hadoop/Spark)
â—¦ Good written and verbal communication skills
