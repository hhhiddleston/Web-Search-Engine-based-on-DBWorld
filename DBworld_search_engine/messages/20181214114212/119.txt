ICCSA 2019 is the next event in the series of highly successful International Conferences on Computational Science and Its Applications, previously held in Melbourne - Australia (2018), Trieste - Italy (2017), Beijing - China (2016), Banff - Canada (2015), Guimaraes - Portugal (2014), Ho Chi Minh City - Vietnam (2013), Salvador da Bahia - Brazil (2012), Santander - Spain (2011), Fukuoka - Japan (2010), Suwon - Korea (2009), Perugia - Italy (2008), Kuala Lumpur - Malaysia (2007), Glasgow - United Kingdom (2006), Singapore - Singapore(2005), Assisi - Italy (2004), Montreal - Canada (2003), and, as ICCS, in Amsterdam - The Netherlands (2002) and San Francisco - USA (2001).

Computational Science is a main pillar of most of the present research, industrial and commercial activities and plays a unique role in exploiting ICT innovative technologies.

The ICCSA Conference offers a real opportunity to bring together scientists of different disciplines, discuss new issues, tackle complex problems and find advanced solutions breeding new trends in Computational Science.

Submitted papers will be subject to stringent peer review by at least three experts and carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. Accepted papers will appear in the Conference proceedings to be published by Springer-Verlag in Lecture Notes for Computer Science and, as post-Conference proceedings, Conference Publishing System (CPS). The authors of a selected number of top quality papers will be requested to extend their papers for further review and publication as special issues in highly recognized international journals.

ICCSA 2019 accepts paper submission in the following categories: main Conference theme papers and Workshop papers . The details for each paper submission category can be found at the URL http://www.iccsa.org/nstructions-for-authors and the list of Workshops at the URL: http://www.iccsa.org/workshops.

To submit a paper, please connect to the Submission site from the link available at the ICCSA 2019 web site: https://ess.iccsa.org. 
Only papers submitted through the electronic system and strictly adhering to the relevant format will be considered for reviewing and publication.
The submission may fall into the following five categories: Main Conference Theme Papers (LNCS), Special Session/Workshop Papers (LNCS or CPS), Short Papers (LNCS), and PHD Showcase Papers (CPS).

MAIN CONFERENCE THEME PAPERS (LNCS)
The submitted paper must be camera-ready, between 10 and 16 pages long and formatted according to the LNCS rules. Please consult the URL http://www.iccsa.org/instructions-for-authors for formatting information and templates.


WORKSHOPS PAPERS (LNCS or CPS)
The submitted paper must be between 10 to 16 pages long for LNCS publication, or 7 to 11 pages for CPS publication (in such case as post-conference proceedings), and should be formatted according to the LNCS or CPS rules, respectively.
Please consult the URL http://www.iccsa.org/instructions-for-authors for formatting information and templates.

SHORT PAPERS (LNCS)
Reporting preliminary results of ongoing research. The submitted paper must be between 7 and 9 pages long formatted according to LNCS rules. The Short Papers will be presented during the conference and will be published by LNCS.

PHD SHOWCASE PAPERS (CPS)
