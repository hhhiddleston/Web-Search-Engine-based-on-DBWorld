I am a PhD in Massive Data Computing Center ( the School of Computer Science and Technology at Harbin Institute of Technology). 
You need a sharp post-doctoral researcher with great attention to detail good skills. My education and training make me an ideal candidate for this position. 

My research interests are focused on big data management in distributed system including parallel query processing through large-scale data. My research contributions have been to design efficient distributed indexes, implement effectives algorithms and study some query cases and problems related to trajectory data. 
I am excited about the opportunity to join a competent team. I have had several advising experiences during PhD duration. My most important paper is published in information science journal. After my PhD, I view working as an essential and enjoyable part of being a scientific researcher member in scientific team. 

Best regards,
