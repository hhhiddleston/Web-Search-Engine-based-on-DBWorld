Call for Submissions:
---------------------
The ACM Multimedia Systems Conference (MMSys) provides a forum for researchers
to present and share their latest research findings in multimedia systems.
While research about specific aspects of multimedia systems are regularly
published in the various proceedings and transactions of the networking,
operating systems, real-time systems, databases, mobile computing, distributed
systems, computer vision, and middleware communities, MMSys aims to cut across
these domains in the context of multimedia data types. This provides a unique
opportunity to investigate the intersections and the interplay of the various
approaches and solutions developed across these domains to deal with
multimedia data types.

MMSys is a venue for researchers who explore:
- Complete multimedia systems that provide a new kind of multimedia experience
  or systems whose overall performance improves the state-of-the-art through
  new research results in more than one component, or
- Enhancements to one or more system components that provide a documented
  improvement over the state-of-the-art for handling continuous media or
  time-dependent services.

Such individual system components include:
- Operating systems
- Distributed architectures and protocol enhancements
- Domain languages, development tools, and abstraction layers
- Using new architectures or computing resources for multimedia
- New or improved I/O architectures or I/O devices, innovative uses, and
  algorithms for their operation
- Representation of continuous or time-dependent media
- Metrics, measures, and measurement tools to assess performance

This touches aspects of many hot topics including but not limited to: content
preparation and delivery systems, HDR, games, virtual/augmented/mixed reality,
3D video, immersive systems, plenoptics, 360° video, volumetric video
delivery, multimedia IoT, multi and many-core, GPGPUs, mobile multimedia and
5G, wearable multimedia, P2P, cloud-based multimedia, cyber-physical systems,
multi-sensory experiences, smart cities, QoE.

Papers should be between 6-12 pages long (in PDF format) prepared in the ACM
style and written in English. MMSys papers enable authors to present entire
multimedia systems or research work that builds on considerable amounts of
earlier work in a self-contained manner. MMSys papers are published in the ACM
Digital Library. The papers are double-blind reviewed.

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three TPC members. All
papers will be evaluated for their scientific quality. Authors will have a
chance to submit their rebuttals before online discussions among the TPC
members.

ACM SIGMM has a tradition of publishing open datasets (MMSys) and open source
projects (ACM Multimedia). MMSys 2019 will continue to support scientific
reproducibility, by implementing the ACM reproducibility badge system
(https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging/). All
accepted papers will be contacted by the Reproducibility Chair, inviting the
authors to make their dataset and code available, and thus, obtaining an ACM
badge (visible at the ACM DL). The additional material will be published as
Appendixes, with no effect on the final page count for papers.
