Assistant Professor AI + Data Engineering (Tenure Track)

The Informatics Institute at the University of Amsterdam (http://ivi.uva.nl) is seeking a tenure track assistant professor focused on the intersection of artificial intelligence and data engineering. The successful candidate will have a background in database systems, natural language processing, information science or artificial intelligence. Areas of interest include (but are not limited to): automated knowledge base construction, information integration, semi-structured/semantic data management, and machine learning for data management.

You will be joining the newly formed INtelligent Data Engineering Lab (INDE lab) - INDElab.org. The lab's broad aim is to tackle problems relating to the preparation, management, integration and reuse of data using empirical insights into data science practice. The lab is situated within Amsterdamâ€™s larger data science and artificial intelligence ecosystem (e.g. amsterdamdatascience.nl, icai.ai) and values practice-informed and interdisciplinary research and outreach.
