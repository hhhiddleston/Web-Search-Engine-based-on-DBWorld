INTRODUCTION 
============= 
The IEEE International Conference on Cloud and Big Data Computing is a premier forum for researchers, practitioners and developers who are interested in cloud computing and big data to explore new ideas, techniques and tools, as well as to exchange experience. Besides the latest research achievements, the conference covers also innovative commercial data management systems, innovative commercial applications of cloud computing and big data technology, and experience in applying recent research advances to real-world problems. 
IEEE CBDCom 2019 will be the fifth edition of the conference after the success of CBDCom 2015 in Beijing, CBDCom 2016 in Toulouse, CBDCom 2017 in San Francisco, and CBDCom 2018 in Guangzhou.  It will continuously offer a platform for researchers to exchange novel studies, discuss important issues and explore key challenges in innovative cloud and big data for smarter world.

IEEE CBDCom 2019 will be held on August 5-8, 2019, co-located with IEEE CyberSciTech 2019, IEEE DASC 2019 and IEEE PICom 2019, in Fukuoka, Japan.

============
SUBMISSION 
============
Authors are invited to submit their original research work that has not previously been submitted or published in any other venue. 
Papers should be prepared in IEEE CS Proceedings format. 
IEEE formatting information:
http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html

- Proposals for organizing tutorials, workshops and special sessions need to be submitted to the Tutorials, Workshops and Special Sessions Chairs, respectively. A proposal should include title, theme, scope and main presenters/organizers.
- Research paper (6-8 pages) should explore a specific technology problem and propose a complete solution to it, with experimental results. 
- Works-in-Progess (WIP) (4-6 pages) papers are expected to present either work currently in progress or less developed but highly innovative ideas. 
- Demo/Poster papers (2-4 pages) must describe working systems and be related to CBDCom. These systems may be innovative prototype implementations or mature systems that use related technology.

Some papers originally submitted as full papers can be accepted as short papers or posters during the review process. In such cases, the authors will need to reduce the paper accordingly when preparing the camera-ready version. At least one of the authors of any accepted paper is requested to register and present the paper at the conference. 
All accepted papers in the main tracks and workshops will be published in an IEEE Computer Society proceedings (EI indexed).

========================
