ICDCN 2019 is soliciting submissions as either regular or short papers. Regular Papers should not exceed 10 pages double column 
           including figures, tables, and references in standard ACM format. Additional details may be included in a clearly-marked 
            appendix (containing all technical ideas and proofs necessary for an expert to fully verify the claims of the paper) 
            that will be read at the discretion of the program committee. Short Papers should not exceed 5 pages double column 
            including figures, tables, and references in standard ACM format. Papers must be submitted electronically in printable
            PDF form via the EasyChair submission management system. Some papers not accepted as regular papers may be accepted as 
            short papers with 5 pages in the proceedings, while full papers will be allowed 10 pages. At least one author of each 
            accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper.

 BEST PAPER AWARD: The ICDCN TPC plans to award a Best Paper Award, independently for each of the two tracks. This award will be 
                    based on the paper's technical merit, the opinions of the reviewers and the presentation quality at the 
                     conference.
 SPECIAL ISSUE: The authors of selected best papers in the Distributed Computing track will be invited to submit an extended version
                of their paper for publication in Elsevier's Theoretical Computer Science (TCS - A) journal. The authors of selected 
                best papers in the Networking track will be invited to submit an extended version of their paper for publication in
                Elsevier's Pervasive and Mobile Computing (PMC) journal.
                 For inquiries, contact Local Organizing Committee Co-Chairs, R. C. Hansdah (hansdah@iisc.ac.in) or
