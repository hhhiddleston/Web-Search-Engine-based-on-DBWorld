Call for Next Generation Data Scientists (NGDS) Award 

The 2018 NGDS Awards will be announced at DSAA'2018 in Turin, Italy. All full-time PhD students and ECRs in data science-related areas are encouraged to apply. Candidates with the acceptance of long-presentation papers at DSAA conferences are particularly encouraged to apply.


NGDS INTRODUCTION

One of critical challenges facing the era of data science lies in the significant gap between the increasing data scientist job requirements and the limited availability of qualified data scientists. The Steering Committee of the IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA, website: http://www.dsaa.co/) decided to launch the prestigious award: Next Generation Data Scientist (NGDS) Awards, to address this gap and encourage young talents to conduct foundational research and applied innovation work in Data Science and Analytics.

The NGDS Award is the only one in the world that supports the production of qualified data scientists. Every year, DSAA will offer a limited number of NGDS Awards to full-time research students and early-career researchers who have just got doctorate degrees within five years to the application (ECR for short). The NGDS awards will be sponsored by some of DSAA sponsors. Each NGDS awardee will receive USD1,000. 

The first NGDS Award was announced at DSAA'2016 in Montreal, Canada. Assistant Professor David Anastasiu at the San Jos?? State University received the 2016 NGDS Award.

DSAA Steering Committee wants the NGDS Awards to be highly prestigious and selective, hence the criteria for NGDS candidate selection are rigorous. This may involve the following aspects:
