CALL FOR PAPERS
-------------------

Recent years have witnessed unprecedented amounts of data being generated from
different hardware or software in the form of streams of data. Examples of
this phenomenon are crucial for several applications and domains including
financial markets, surveillance systems, manufacturing, smart cities and
scalable monitoring infrastructure. In all of these applications and domains,
there is a crucial requirement to collect, process, and analyze big streams of
data in order to extract valuable information, discover new insights in
real-time and to detect emerging patterns and outliers. The goal of this
workshop is to provide a forum for people in both academia and industry to
present their most recent work and to foster exchange of new ideas in the area
of big data streams.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following:

* Learning on streams
* State management in stream processing
* Distributed stream processing
* Transactions on streams
* Geo-distributed streams
* Stream processing languages
* Complex event processing
* Stream processing on modern hardware
* Approximate stream processing
* Distributed data stream summarization
* Data stream mining
