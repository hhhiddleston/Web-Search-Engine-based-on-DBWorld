The Department of Engineering of Roma Tre University is seeking two or three professors for a visit of a period ranging from two weeks to a whole semester (twelve weeks), in the academic year 2018-2019 (detailed dates are subject to negotiation, between March 1, 2019 and June 10, 2019). The main requirement would be to teach about 6 hours per week, in an advanced graduate course in the broad area of Computer Science, with the opportunity to be involved in one or more of our research groups. All activities will be conducted in English.

Preferably, the candidate should hold a position at the level of an associate professor or higher at a recognized tertiary academic institution (e.g., a university or research institute).

The position will have a remuneration that will suffice to cover the accommodation and living expenses in Rome as well as traveling expenses, but not a full salary adequate for a professor's position.

Course content can be agreed upon, as the goal is to have courses that effectively complement those currently offered in the local programs.

Interested colleagues should contact, with a CV (including areas of interest, teaching experiences, publications), by September 30th, 2018 professor Paolo Merialdo . All members of the Computer Science and Automation Division of the department (http://www.inf.uniroma3.it) are available for inquiries and preliminary discussions.
