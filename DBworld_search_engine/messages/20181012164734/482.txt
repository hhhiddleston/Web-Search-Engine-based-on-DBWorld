Thank you so much for the excellent contributions from scientific and
applied disciplines and for the active support from all participants,
speakers, panelists, independent peer reviewers, from the chairs,
committees, and moderators, from the editorial supporters and
other volunteers, over the past years! Your contributions and active
support have made the INFOCOMP conferences a successful and most
lively event series with highest quality standards and publications!

INFOCOMP 2019 continues a successful series of events
dedicated to advanced communications and computing aspects, covering academic
and industrial achievements and visions. We solicit both academic, research,
and industrial contributions. We welcome technical papers presenting research
and practical results, position papers addressing the pros and cons of specific
proposals, such as those being discussed in the standard fora or in industry
consortia, survey papers addressing the key problems and solutions on any of
the above topics short papers on work in progress, and panel proposals. Tracks
feature trends and advances, application scenarios, state of the art, and
outreach developments of advanced scientific computing, supercomputing, HPC,
and communication from present to future architectures, integrated systems,
beyond cloud, and reaching exaflop: large scale and fast computation,
networks/systems communications, measurement, control and management, advanced
applications from geosciences, scientific data processing, natural sciences,
archaeology, planetology, spatial and environmental sciences, geoprocessing,
integrated information and computing systems, intelligent systems, mobility,
legal informatics, database applications, as well as tracks on evaluation
context, biometry, security, access technologies, algorithms, and applications.

In 2019 INFOCOMP, again, also hosts MODOPT 2019,
the Special Track on Modeling and Optimization.

The conference aims on bringing together world's leading international experts,
researchers, computational scientists, developers, system managers, users,
doctoral students, and industry and business affiliates for sharing
experiences, publishing and presenting new research results and discussing
recent developments, challenges, and future advancements and collaboration in
exciting keynotes, expert panels, workshops, special sessions, and tutorials.

In this context, in addition to the Call for Papers
please also note the chance for proposals on
TUTORIALS, PANELS, SPECIAL SESSIONS, WORKSHOPS, AND SYMPOSIA.

Wish you all the best with your research and beyond!

Looking forward to your contributions and hopefully seeing you in Nice!

Kind regards,
Dr. Claus-Peter Rueckemann
INFOCOMP General Chair and Chair of the Steering Committee
