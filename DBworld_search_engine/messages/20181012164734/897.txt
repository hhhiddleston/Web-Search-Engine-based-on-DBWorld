CALL FOR PAPERS
8th International Symposium on Secure Virtual Infrastructures --
Cloud and Trusted Computing (C&TC 2018)
October 22-26, 2018 -- Valletta, Malta
http://www.otmconferences.org

Description
===========

Current and future service-based software needs to remain focused towards the development and deployment of large and complex intelligent and networked information systems, required for internet-based and intranet-based systems in organizations, as well to move to IoT integration and big data analytics. Today, service-based software covers a very wide range of application domains as well as technologies and research issues. This has found realization through Cloud Computing, Big Data, and IoT. Vital element in such networked, virtualized, and sensor-based information systems are the notions of trust, security, privacy and risk management.

Cloud and Trusted Computing (C&TC 2018) is the 8th International Symposium on Cloud Computing, Trusted Computing and Secure Virtual Infrastructures, organized as a component conference of the OnTheMove Federated Conferences & Workshops. C&TC 2018 will be held in Valletta, Malta.

The conference solicits submissions from both academia and industry presenting novel research in the context of Cloud Computing, Big Data, and IoT, presenting theoretical and practical approaches to cloud, big data, and IoT trust, security, privacy and risk management. The conference will provide a special focus on the intersection between cloud paradigm, big data analytics, and IoT integration, bringing together experts from the three communities to discuss on the vital issues of trust, security, privacy and risk management in Cloud Computing, shedding the light on novel issues and requirements in big data and IoT domains. Potential contributions could cover new approaches, methodologies, protocols, tools, or verification and validation techniques. We also welcome review papers that analyze critically the current status of trust, security, privacy and risk management in the cloud, big data, and IoT. Papers from practitioners who encounter trust, security, privacy, and risk management problems, and seek understanding are finally welcome.

FULL PAPERS
Regular paper submissions to Cloud and Trusted Computing 2018 (C&TC 2018) must present original, highly innovative, prospective and forward-looking research in one or more of the themes given above. Full papers must break new ground, present new insight, deliver a significant research contribution and provide validated support for its results and conclusions. Successful submissions typically represent a major advance for the fields of cloud computing, big data, and IoT referencing and relating the contribution to existing research work, giving a comprehensive, detailed and understandable explanation of a system, study, theory or methodology, and support the findings with a compelling evaluation and/or validation. Each paper must be submitted as a single PDF file in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science format (no longer than 18 pages in length). Accepted regular papers will be included in the conference main proceedings and presented in the paper sessions. Submissions to C&TC 2018 must not be under review by any other conference or publication at any time during the C&TC review cycle, and must not be previously published or accepted for publication elsewhere.


NOTES (SHORT PAPERS)
Short papers (not longer than 6 pages in length) must report new results and provide support for the results, as a novel and valuable contribution to the field â€“ just like full papers. Short papers are intended for succinct work that is nonetheless in a mature state ready for inclusion in archival proceedings. Short papers will be held to the same standard of scientific quality as full papers, albeit for a shorter presentation, and must still state how they fit with respect to related work, and provide a compelling explanation and validation. Short papers must be submitted as single PDF file in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science format. Accepted short papers will be published in the conference main proceedings and will be presented in the paper sessions of the conference.


*Best papers will be invited in a special issue on the Future Generation Computer Systems journal (to be confirmed).
