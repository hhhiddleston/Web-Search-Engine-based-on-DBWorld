The successful candidate will be located at the School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow, UK. The appointment is for up to 3 years in the first instance and the salary is commensurate with experience. The position will involve working closely with the technical team at JP Morgan's Glasgow office, and there will be opportunities during the project for internships at JP Morgan. The successful candidate will also be expected to contribute to the formulation and submission of research publications and research proposals as well as help manage and direct this complex and challenging project as opportunities allow.
