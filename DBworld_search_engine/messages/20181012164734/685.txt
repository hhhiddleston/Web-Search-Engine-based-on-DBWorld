THE 19TH IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON CLUSTER, CLOUD AND GRID COMPUTING (IEEE/ACM CCGrid 2019) 


**** CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS ****
(Papers, Workshop Proposals, Tutorial Proposals, Doctoral Symposium, SCALE)


CALL FOR PAPERS 

Advances in architectures, networks, systems and middleware technologies are leading to new concepts and platforms for computing, ranging from Clusters and Grids to Clouds and Datacenters, and result in an outstanding impact to numerous aspects of the modern world. The 19th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium in Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing (CCGrid 2019) is a forum bringing together international researchers, developers, and practitioners to present leading research activities and results on a broad range of topics related to these concepts, platforms, and their applications. The conference features keynotes, technical presentations, workshops, and posters, as well as the Doctoral Symposium and the SCALE challenge featuring live demonstrations. CCGrid has travelled over the world. Its next stop is in beautiful Larnaca, Cyprus, in May 2019.  

Papers due: December 7, 2018 
Author notifications: January 18, 2019

CALL FOR WORKSHOPS 

Workshops should provide forums for discussion among researchers and practitioners on focused topics or emerging research areas relevant to the community. Organizers may structure workshops as they see fit, including invited talks, panel discussions, presentations of work in progress, fully peer-reviewed papers, or some combination of the above. Workshops could be scheduled for half a day or a full day, depending on interest, space constraints, and organizer preference. Organizers should design workshops for approximately 20-40 participants, to balance impact and effective discussion. 

Deadline for Workshop Proposals: September 30, 2018 
Notifications of Acceptance: October 15, 2018

CALL FOR TUTORIALS 

CCGrid 2019 will feature state-of-the-art tutorials from leading experts in their fields. Topics will cover different levels, ranging from introductory to highly advanced skills. All tutorials will address highly important and relevant subject areas of cluster computing and grid technology. To provide the best possible tutorial offerings, CCGrid 2019 solicits proposals for half day (3,5 hours) or full day tutorials. 

Deadline for Tutorial Proposals: January 15, 2019 
Notification of Acceptance: February 15, 2019

CALL FOR DOCTORAL SYMPOSIUM 

The Doctoral Symposium of the 19th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGrid2019) provides a forum for students in all areas of Cluster, Grid and Cloud research to obtain visibility, feedback and advice on their Ph.D. dissertation topics and on their research careers. The Symposium promotes fruitful interactions and networking between student researchers at a similar stage in their careers. The program committee consists of experts in the field and will provide their valuable feedback to the ongoing research work of participating students. Selected students will present their work in front of an audience of both their peer and researchers and will also be invited to present their work as a poster in the poster exhibition of CCGrid. The proceedings of the doctoral symposium will be published as part of CCGrid 2019 Proceedings through the IEEE Computer Society Conference Publishing Services and will be submitted to IEEE Xplore for EI indexing. 

Papers due  January 15, 2019 
Author Notification: February 15, 2019

CALL FOR THE 12TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SCALABLE COMPUTING CHALLENGE (SCALE 2019) 

The 12th IEEE International Scalable Computing Challenge (SCALE 2019) is sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC). The objective of the SCALE Challenge is to highlight and showcase real-world problem solving using computing that scales. Effective solutions to many scientific and engineering problems require applications that can scale. There are different dimensions to application scalability. For example, applications can scale-up to a large number of cores on a compute unit, scale-out to utilize multiple distinct compute units, or exhibit elastic scaling to acquire and release resources on-demand, based on current need. The result may be an application that can solve a larger problem, increase throughput, and/or reduce execution time. In order to scale, applications need to be supported by tools, middleware, software cyber-infrastructure, programming frameworks, computing infrastructure, etc. The SCALE Challenge is concerned with advances in application development and their supporting infrastructure to enable scaling. All papers presented at the SCALE challenge and selected by the Scale Challenge Committee of IEEE/ACM CCGrid 2019 will be submitted to IEEE Xplore for publication and EI indexing. 

Proposal submission: 31 Jan 2019
