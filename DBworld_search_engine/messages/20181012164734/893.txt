Call for Submissions
Third ACM SIGSPATIAL Student Research Completion 
http://sigspatial2018.sigspatial.org/competition/ 
***********************************************************************
Following the successful events in 2016 and 2017, SIGPATIAL 2018 will host 
the third ACM SIGSPATIAL Student Research Competition (SRC, 
http://src.acm.org/) this year too. SRC enables undergraduate and graduate 
students to share their research results and exchange ideas with other 
students, judges, and conference attendees; understand the practical 
applications of their research; perfect their communication skills; receive 
prizes and gain recognition from ACM and the greater computing community.

Guidelines

The Student Research Competition is open to graduate (only one author) and 
undergraduate (up to two authors per contribution) student members whose 
submissions are accepted by the SRC committee. SRC submissions should 
describe recent research conducted primarily by students or a recent 
development that involves a substantial amount of work achieved primarily by 
students. To be considered, complete a submission of an extended abstract of 
a topic of interest to the ACM SIGSPATIAL conference (please check the main 
conference CFP for relevant topics: http://sigspatial2018.sigspatial.org/cfp/) 
and indicate the level of  the participation (undergraduate or graduate). 
Valid ACM student membership and student status enrolment as of the 
submission deadline are required for the lead student. 

Selection Process

Submission will be judged based on novelty, impact, approach, results, and 
contributions to the field of spatial systems and algorithms. Selected 
competitors must attend the SRC session during the conference and should 
prepare a poster for demonstrating their work during the conference. If 
selected for further competition at the next level, they should be prepared 
to give a short talk of 10 minutes about their research projects in front of 
the judging committee and conference attendees. Winners of the SIGSPTIAL 2018 
SRC will be announced at the conference. 

Awards

Selected competitors by the SRC committee will receive up to $500 USD for 
their conference travel, depending on need. Winners from each category will 
advance to the SRC Grand Finals, where winners from various ACM SIGs are 
evaluated to nominate the ACM-wide SRC winners. The winners of the Grand 
Finals will be recognized at the Annual ACM Awards Banquet, the same banquet 
that also recognizes the Turing Award winners.

Sponsors

The SRC competition is fully sponsored by a generous donation from Microsoft 
Research.

Submission Instructions

Each submission should include the author(s)' name(s), affiliations, email 
address(es), research advisors' names, ACM student member number, SRC 
category (undergraduate or graduate), and an extended abstract of no more 
than two pages in the conference template. The SRC submission should not have 
been published before or be concurrently under submission to another 
venue/SIGSPATIAL track. Submissions should be made through the EasyChair 
system at:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acmsigspatial18src
