          31st International Workshop on Description Logics, DL 2018
            October 26th to October 29th, 2018 - Tempe, Arizona, US

            --- PAPER REGISTRATION/SUBMISSION DEADLINE EXTENDED ---
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The DL workshop is the major annual event of the description logic research
community. It is the forum at which those interested in description logics,
both from academia and industry, meet to discuss ideas, share information and
compare experiences. The 31st edition will be held in Tempe, Arizona, US from
October 26th to October 29th, 2018, collocated with the 16th International
Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR 2018).

Workshop Scope
==============
We invite contributions on all aspects of description logics, including but
not limited to:
* Foundations of description logics: decidability and complexity of reasoning,
  expressive power, novel inference problems, inconsistency management,
  reasoning techniques, and modularity aspects
* Extensions of description logics: closed-world and nonmonotonic reasoning,
  epistemic reasoning, temporal and spatial reasoning, procedural knowledge,
  query answering, reasoning over dynamic information
* Integration of description logics with other formalisms: object-oriented
  representation languages, database query languages, constraint-based
  programming, logic programming, and rule-based systems
* Applications and use areas of description logics: ontology engineering,
  ontology languages, databases, ontology-based data access, semi-structured
  data, graph structured data, linked data, document management, natural
  language, learning, planning, Semantic Web, cloud computing, conceptual
  modelling, web services, business processes
* Systems and tools around description logics: reasoners, software tools for
  and using description logic reasoning (e.g. ontology editors, database
  schema design, query optimisation, and data integration tools),
  implementation and optimisation techniques, benchmarking, evaluation,
  modelling

Submissions
===========
Submissions may be of two types:

(1) Regular submissions consist of 11 pages LNCS plus references. If the authors prefer the paper to not appear in the proceedings, an additional 2-page abstract has to be submitted.

(2) Papers accepted at some conference can be submitted as accepted elsewhere together with a 2-page abstract that also specifies where the paper has been accepted.

* For both types, there is no page limit on the list of references.
* For submissions with an additional 2-page abstract, only the abstract is
  published in the proceedings. The abstracts might not be indexed in dblp.
  This option is designed for authors who wish to announce results that have
  been published elsewhere, or which the authors intend to submit or have
  already submitted to a venue with an incompatible prior / concurrent
  publication policy.
* All submissions may optionally include a clearly marked appendix (e.g.,
  with additional proofs or evaluation data). The appendix will be read at
  the discretion of the reviewers and not included in the proceedings. The
  appendix does not need to be in LNCS format.
* Accepted papers and 2-page abstracts will be made available electronically
  in the CEUR Workshop Proceedings series (http://www.CEUR-ws.org/).
* Accepted submissions, be they full papers or 2-page abstracts, will be
  selected for either oral or poster presentation at the workshop. Submissions
  will be judged solely based upon their content, and the type of submission
  will have no bearing on the decision between oral and poster presentation.
