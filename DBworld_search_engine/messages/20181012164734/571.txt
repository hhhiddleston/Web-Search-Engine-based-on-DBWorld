The 40th International Conference on Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency will take place in Aachen Germany in the last week of June 2019. The conference will be co-located with the 19th International Conference on Application of Concurrency to System Design (ACSD 2019). The conference will have several special events to celebrate the 40 year history of the conference.

The 40th annual international Petri Nets conference will be organized by the Process and Data Science (PADS) group at RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany. The new PADS group was established in the context of Wil van der Aalst’s Alexander von Humboldt Professorship. The conference will take place in the conference area of the Tivoli football stadium close to the city center of Aachen. The language of the conference is English, and its proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in Lecture Notes in Computer Science. Papers presenting original research on application or theory of Petri nets, as well as contributions addressing topics relevant to the general field of distributed and concurrent systems are sought. All accepted regular papers will be considered for an “Outstanding Paper” award. Some of the best papers will be invited, in an extended form, as submissions to a special issue of a well-established computer science journal.

General Topics Related to Concurrency

Model checking and verification of distributed systems
Verification of infinite-state or parametric systems
Causality/partial order theory of concurrency
Educational issues related to concurrency
New developments in the theory of concurrency
Modelling of hardware and biological systems

Topics Specific to Petri Nets

Analysis and synthesis, structure and behavior of nets
System design and model-driven development using nets
Relationships between Petri nets and other approaches
Net-based semantical, logical and algebraic calculi
Higher-level net models (colored nets, timed nets, etc.)
Stochastic net models
Verification and model checking using nets
Process discovery and conformance checking
Computer tools for nets
Standardization of nets
Experience reports describing applications of nets to different kinds of systems and application fields.

Paper Submission

Two kinds of papers can be submitted:

Regular papers (max 20 pages) describing original results pertaining to the development of the theory of Petri Nets and distributed and concurrent systems in general, new results extending the applicability of Petri Nets, or case studies, application and experience reports pertinent to the practical use of Petri Nets and concurrency.
Tool papers (max 10 pages) describing a computer tool based on Petri Nets (not an application of the tool or the theory behind the tool). The tool should be available for use by other groups (but not necessarily for free). The submission should indicate how the reviewers can get access to the tool (this must be for free). The tool will be demonstrated in the Tool Exhibition, in addition to being presented in a conference talk.

Tool Exhibition

An exhibition of Petri Net tools will take place on Wednesday. It consists of informal demonstrations for small groups/individuals, and there are no scheduled talks. Requests for participation in the tool exhibition must be sent to the Tool Exhibition Chair by the deadline stated at the top of this Call for Papers. They should include a link to the web pages for the tool (or a short description of the tool). The demonstrators should bring their own laptops, while the organizers may be requested to give access to the Internet.

Courses, Workshops and Tutorials

The main conference takes place from Wednesday to Friday. The three days before the main conference also offer a wide range of activities. The Petri Net Course takes place from Sunday to Tuesday. It offers a thorough introduction to Petri Nets in four half-day modules on Sunday and Monday, and a full-day tutorial module on Tuesday. For successful participation in the entire course, including preparation and examination, three credit points (ECTS) will be awarded. Each module of the course can also be taken separately, without any credit.

Workshops take place on Monday and Tuesday. On Tuesday there will be two tutorials on applications of Petri Nets and/or new developments presented by experts in the area. These tutorials can be followed independently or in combination with the Petri Net Course. Detailed descriptions of Workshops and Tutorials will be made available via the conference web pages.
