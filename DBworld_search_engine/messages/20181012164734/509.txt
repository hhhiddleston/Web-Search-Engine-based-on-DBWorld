What is IEEE DSAA
--------------------------------
The IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA) aims to be the flagship annual meeting spanning the interdisciplinary field of Data Science. DSAA focuses on the science of data science, as well as the implications of the science for applications to industry, government, and society. From the science side, DSAA spans all of the component fields of data science, including statistics, probabilistic and mathematical modeling, machine learning, data mining and knowledge discovery, complexity science, network science, business analytics, data management, infrastructure and storage, retrieval and search, security, privacy and ethics. From the applications side, DSAA aims both to show researchers important problems and issues that are revealed by real applications, and to show practitioners and users how the science can be applied to realize value. DSAA is intended to reflect the interdisciplinary nature of data science and analytics, as an alternative to the highly specialized disciplinary conferences.

DSAA 2018 in Turin, Italy, is the 5th annual installment of the conference. This year brings the collaboration of the American Statistical Association, to complement the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society and the ACM SIGKDD. This year DSAA also adds the support of the ISI Foundation, which has worked for 35 years to break down traditional silos in the sciences of complexity and data.
