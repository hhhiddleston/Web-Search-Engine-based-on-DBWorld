Introduction
The proliferation of new technologies such as Internet of Things and cloud computing calls for innovative ideas to retrieve, filter, and integrate data from a large number of diverse data sources. Big Data is an emerging paradigm applied to datasets whose volume/velocity/variability is beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to manage and process the data within a tolerable period of time. More importantly, Big Data has to be of high value, and should be protected in an efficient way. Since Big Data involves a huge amount of data that is of high-dimensionality and inter-linkage, existing trust, security, and privacy measures for traditional databases and infrastructures cannot satisfy its requirements. Novel technologies for protecting Big Data are attracting researchers and practitioners with more and more attention.
 
Scope and Interests
TrustData2018 is a part of SpaCCS 2018 (http://www.swinflow.org/confs/2018/spaccs/index.htm),  11th International Conference on

(2) Trust management and evaluation for Big Data
(3) Trusted systems, software, and applications for Big Data
(4) Trusted platform implementation technologies for Big Data
(5) Information quality/trustworthiness for Big Data
(6) Provenance of content for Big Data
(7) Trustworthiness of ratings/recommender systems for Big Data
 
Security Track
(1) Security model and architecture for Big Data
(2) Data mining security for Big Data
(3) Software and system security for Big Data
(4) Intrusion detection for Gigabit Networks
(5) Cryptography and Big Data
(6) Visualizing large scale security data
(7) Threat detection using Big Data analytics
(8) Human computer interaction challenges for Big Data security
(9) Data protection, integrity standards and policies
(10) Security and legislative impacts for Big Data
(11) Managing user access for Big Data
(12) Secure quantum communications
 
Privacy Track
