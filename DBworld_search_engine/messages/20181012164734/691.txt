+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Asia-Pacific Conference on Conceptual Modelling provides an annual forum for disseminating the results of innovative research in information modelling and related areas. The fifteenth conference of the series will be held from January 29 to January 31 as a track of the Australasian Computer Science Week (ACSW 2019), hosted at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia. Registration will enable delegates to attend sessions in any conference participating in the Australasian Computer Science Week. A full list of conferences and further details of ACSW can be accessed at http://www.acsw.org.au/

=============================
Scope
=============================

The amount, complexity and diversity of data held in computer systems is constantly on the rise, and so are the requirements and challenges that need to be met to ensure useful access and manipulation of this information. Conceptual Modelling is fundamental to the development of up-to-date information and knowledge-based systems. The conference series aims at bringing together experts from all areas of computer science and information systems with a common interest in the subject.

=============================
Paper Submission & Publication
=============================

APCCM invites papers describing original contributions in all fields of conceptual modelling and related areas. Papers should be no more than 10 pages in length, conforming to formatting instructions available on the conference website. Each paper will be judged on its originality, significance, technical quality, relevance and presentation. Submission to APCCM 2019 will be via the EasyChair submission system. APCCM 2019 proceedings will be published in the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series and included in the ACM Digital Library as part of a joint proceedings for ACSW.

Please note that it is ACSW policy that at least one author of all accepted papers to the conferences and workshops in the series has to register and present at the relevant event. Failure to do so without a reason acceptable to the organisers of the event will result in the paper being retrospectively withdrawn from both the proceedings and all citation sources. It is also ACSW policy that all papers be original and not concurrently submitted elsewhere. Once again, we reserve the right to retrospectively withdraw a paper from the proceedings if we later find this not to be the case.
