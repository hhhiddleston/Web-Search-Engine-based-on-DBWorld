ZEUS 2019: CALL FOR PAPERS                       [Apologies for cross-postings]

===============================================================================

11th ZEUS Workshop

February 14-15, 2019 in Bayreuth, Germany   http://zeus2019.org

===============================================================================

================================
Participation is free of charge!
================================

Objectives
==========

ZEUS focuses on the discussion of fresh ideas, the presentation of work in
progress, and the establishment of a scientific network between young
researchers in the region.

1. Discuss fresh ideas

We offer a forum to discuss ideas at a level that is more work-in-progress than
in a traditional conference. We thereby want to attract especially PhD students
in the early phases of their work. Participants can get feedback from outside
their group before a submission to a reviewed conference. This makes ZEUS an
original opportunity to discuss ideas.

2. Practice scientific work

We see the ZEUS workshop as an opportunity to practice the whole range of
scientific work. We do not take the sole focus on the submitted papers, but
also on the presentations and the discussions during the workshop. To this end,
we hand out a Best Presentation Award since 2010 at the end of the workshop to
appreciate high quality presentations.

3. Establish contacts between young researchers in the region

We aim at bringing together young researchers who work in the same geographic
and scientific region. This way, we would like to provide an
opportunity for people to establish a scientific network that can be intensely
used, including mutual visits at affordable costs. The workshop will serve as a
platform to present current research ideas and research directions.

Topics
======
The topics of the ZEUS workshop are centered around service technologies, which
includes a rich set of facets. The purpose of analysis, synthesis, or simulation
of service technologies are as welcome as practical evaluations, use case-driven
feasibility studies, or technology adoption models. ZEUS also calls for
contributions in the field of Cloud Computing, RESTful services, and microservices.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Service lifecycle: analysis, specification, modelling, testing, deployment,
  execution, monitoring, adaptation
- Patterns, languages, reference models, and model extensions
- Multi-view and multi-perspective engineering (SOA, choreographies,
  collaborations, conversations, artifact-centric systems)
- Formal methods, models, simulation, and verification
- System architectures for service composition
- RESTful Web services (design aspects, hypermedia, linked data, mashups,
  conversations)
- Microservices and Nanoservices (architecture, lifecycle, deployment, composition)
- Workflows and business processes
- Complex event processing (correlation, aggregation, transformation, monitoring,
  extraction)
- Security, compliance, and non-functional requirements and properties
- Cloud-enabled applications, migration to/from the Cloud, Cloud Integration, Serverless Computing
- Composable Big Data Analytics Pipelines
- Applications, frameworks, methods, tool demonstrations, and case studies


Submission
==========

We are looking forward to three types of contributions for ZEUS 2019. All
papers must be submitted following the instructions at the ZEUS submission site
handled by EasyChair: https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=zeus2019

Results can be presented in talks or tool demonstrations. Submissions will be
reviewed by at least three reviewers each in order to assure general fitness
regarding content, readability and scope and to give first feedback to the
authors. Depending on innovation, technical soundness and presentation clarity,
papers may be rejected or accepted as position or workshop papers.

Workshop papers:
Workshop papers are regular contributions that describe
original solutions in field of ZEUS. These papers must not exceed 6 pages (LNCS
style). Workshop papers are reviewed according to the call for papers. Accepted
papers shall be included in the proceedings and presented at the workshop.

Positions papers:
Position papers should draft a new idea and put it up for
discussion at the workshop. Position papers should only be an extended abstract
and must not exceed 3 pages (LNCS style). Position papers are briefly reviewed
according to the call for papers. The main idea and the relation to existing
work should be contained. Accepted papers shall be included in the proceedings.
Position papers have been introduced based on the experiences gained from the
last editions. They allow authors to get early feedback during the workshop,
but should not disallow extending the paper to a full paper submitted to a
first class conference - even if the position paper is referenced and the
delta is explained properly.

Tools demonstrations:
ZEUS also offers a forum to demonstrate implementations
of techniques and algorithms in the area of the aforementioned topics to get
early feedback and provide interesting insights for the audience. Tool
demonstrators are asked to submit a demo script of no more than 3 pages (LNCS
style) which states how the tool is linked to the call for papers and what to
expect during the demonstration.
