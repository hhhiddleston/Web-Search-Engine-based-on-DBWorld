###### Important Dates  ###### 
Submission Deadline: October 5, 2018 
Acceptance Notification: October 31, 2018 

###### Call for Papers ###### 

Science is increasingly and rapidly becoming digital: research is commonly performed using research infrastructure services and tools available online or on desktop computers; digital products of science are encompassing also datasets, software, and experiments, thereby enabling the Open Science principles of "reproducibility" and "transparent assessment". Accordingly, to keep  their central role in scientific collaboration, Digital libraries must face new theoretical and technical challenges. With this vision in mind, IRCDL invites representatives from academia, government, industry, research communities, research infrastructures, to submit their ideas from a broad and multidisciplinary array of research areas including computer science, information science, social sciences and cultural heritage. 

Topics include (but are not limited to): research impact; citation, provenance and curation of scientific datasets; metadata definition, management, and curation; interlinking of research products; educational practices; long-term preservation of research products; multi-media challenges; novel Scientific Document Models; publishing workflows; novel peer review practices; open Science models; quality and evaluation of digital libraries; scholarly Communication services; user interfaces; and Web solutions.

###### Types of submissions ###### 

*Full research papers* describing original ideas on the listed topics and on other fundamental aspects of digital libraries and technology. Works should not exceed 12-15 pages in the LNCS template.

*Short research papers* on early research results, new results on previous published works, demos, and projects are also welcome. Works should not exceed 6-9 pages in the LNCS template.

This year the conference welcomes also Data papers and Software papers, which can be both â€œfullâ€ and â€œshortâ€ as described above:

*Data papers* presenting motivations, methodology, and value behind the creation of datasets; e.g. annotated corpora, benchmark collections, training sets. 

*Software papers* presenting software functionality, application, and value for the community and encourage its re-use to a non-specialist reader.  

Articles will go through a single-blind review process. For the article to be included in the proceedings, at least one author of accepted papers is required to attend the conference.

###### * Springer Proceedings CCIS * ######

Conference proceedings will be published as a volume of *Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS), Springer Verlag*. IRCDL 2019 papers will be indexed by Scopus, Web of Science and DBLP.

###### * Keynote Speaker and Open Science panels * ######

The conference will feature Susan Davidson (University of Pennsylvenia) as keynote speaker and will host two panels on Open Science and Future of Digital Libraries. See web site for more information.
