-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning
(TIME) is a well-established symposium series which brings together
researchers interested in reasoning about temporal aspects of
information in all areas of computer science. The symposium has a wide
remit and is devoted to both theoretical aspects and well-founded
applications. One of the key aspects of the symposium is its
interdisciplinarity, with attendees from different areas such as
artificial intelligence, database management, logic and verification,
and beyond.

The 25th edition of the symposium (TIME 2018) will be held from 15th
to 17th October 2018 in the city of Warsaw, Poland, hosted by
the Institute of Computer Science of the Polish Academy of Sciences.
