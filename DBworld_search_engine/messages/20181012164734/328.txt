AIMS
****
The Asia-Pacific Conference on Conceptual Modelling provides an annual forum for disseminating the results of innovative research in information modelling and related areas. The fifteenth conference of the series will be held from January 29 to 31 as a track of the Australasian Computer Science Week (ACSW 2019), hosted at Macquarie University, Australia. Registration will enable delegates to attend sessions in any conference participating in the Australasian Computer Science Week. A full list of conferences and further details of ACSW can be accessed at http://www.acsw.org.au/
The amount, complexity and diversity of data held in computer systems is constantly on the increase, and so are the requirements and challenges that need to be met to ensure useful access and manipulation of this information. Conceptual modelling is fundamental to the development of up-to-date information and knowledge-based systems. The conference series aims at bringing together experts from all areas of computer science and information systems with a common interest in the subject.

PAPER SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION
********************************
APCCM 2019 invites papers describing original contributions in all fields of conceptual modelling and related areas. Full papers should be no more than 10 pages, and short papers should be no more than 4 pages, conforming to the ACM conference paper formatting guidelines at http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. Each paper will be judged on its originality, significance, technical quality, relevance and presentation. 

Submission to APCCM 2019 will be electronically only via the EasyChair submission system at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acsw2019

APCCM 2019 proceedings will be published in the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series and included in the ACM Digital Library. Please note that it is ACSW policy that at least one author of all accepted papers to the conferences and workshops in the series has to register and present at the relevant event. Failure to do so without a reason acceptable to the organisers of the event will result in the paper being retrospectively withdrawn from both the proceedings and all citation sources. It is also ACSW policy that all papers be original and not concurrently submitted elsewhere. Once again, we reserve the right to retrospectively withdraw a paper from the proceedings if we later find this not to be the case.
