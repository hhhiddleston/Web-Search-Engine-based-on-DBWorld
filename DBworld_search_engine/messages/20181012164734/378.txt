Scope
The relationship between people affected by any type of difficulty,
both physical and cognitive, and their families or institutional caregivers
is a topic of great importance in the sphere of autonomous and 
independent living.
The request of services to support autonomy is pressing today more than 
ever
and it will increase with the constant change in the structure of the 
population.
The quality of life in the community where the person lives is a 
fundamental
requirement: safety, happiness, affection are just three of the points that
characterize the state of the person.

The purpose of this session is to assess the state of the tools and 
methods to
identify, evaluate, preserve or increase the well-being of the person, 
referred to
as an overall state of physical, emotional, cognitive and social well-being.

Topics
Authors are solicited to submit original, previously unpublished papers
in the following, but not limited to, topic areas:

â€¢ Methodological approaches and tools for assessing well-being of frail 
people
â€¢ Interventions techniques
â€¢ Tools to promote social/emotional/physical well-being
â€¢ Well-being of aging people
â€¢ Wellbeing of caregivers
â€¢ Smart homes/environments

We welcome both theoretical and empirical studies, as well as contributions
from industry/organizations dealing with the special session topic.
