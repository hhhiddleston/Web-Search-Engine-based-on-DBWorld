The University of Ontario Institute of Technology’s (UOIT) Faculty of Business and Information Technology (FBIT) invites applications for a Canada Research Chair (CRC) Tier 2 appointment in Applied Artificial Intelligence in Business and Information Technology. Contingent on the success of the CRC nomination, the successful applicant will be offered a position at the rank of Assistant or Associate Professor. Canada Research Chair nominations are subject to review and approval by the CRC Secretariat. Further details on the CRC Program can be viewed at http://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/

The Faculty of Business and IT seeks an exceptional nominee whose research complements our existing strengths in business, game development, computer security, and networking while transcending traditional AI research in these and other relevant areas. The CRC holder will conduct a world-class research program and build a diverse research team in collaboration with FBIT, UOIT and industry partners, supervise graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, teach courses in the AI field in FBIT and other UOIT faculties (Engineering, Science, etc.), and participate in service to the Faculty, University, and academic/scientific community.

The CRC holder’s research program will utilize facilities and computing resources including the Shared Hierarchical Academic Research Computing Network (SHARCNET), a high-performance computing institute involving numerous academic institutions in southern Ontario, and the Southern Ontario Smart Computing Innovation Platform (SOSCIP), a high-performance computing platform, which provides the computational power needed to perform leading-edge research and store and analyze data. UOIT is also a member of ORION, a high-speed, fibre-optic network that supports research, education, and innovation in Ontario. CRC nominees are eligible for infrastructure support from the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) to help acquire state-of-the-art equipment essential to their work.

CRC Tier 2 awards are intended for exceptional emerging scholars who are no more than 10 years from completion of their highest academic degree. Eligible Tier 2 nominees are acknowledged by their peers as having the potential to lead in their field and demonstrate the potential to achieve international recognition in their fields in the next five to ten years. Where applicable, candidates are encouraged to clarify how a career interruption due to maternity, parental, extended sick and family care leave etc. has impacted their record of achievement (the Tier 2 justification process may be used to review a candidate’s eligibility in such cases. Please contact UOIT’s Office of Research Services for more information: research@uoit.ca). For information regarding CRC Program eligibility criteria, please consult the following webpage: http://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/program-programme/nomination-mise_en_candidature-eng.aspx#s7

In addition, FBIT requires qualified candidates to hold a Ph.D. in a relevant discipline such as Computer Science, Information Technology, Software Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Operations Research, Information Systems or Business with a strong focus on applied AI. The candidate also should demonstrate extensive research experience in AI related methodologies (machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, event-stream processing, natural language processing, etc.).

FBIT is interested in candidates who will proactively advance equity, diversity and inclusion in research activities, curriculum and teaching and can demonstrate their commitment to promoting a respectful work and learning environment at UOIT.

Interested scholars are invited to submit an electronic application package through the UOIT website consisting of the following:
* Cover letter addressing how your career achievements align with the CRC criteria.
* A detailed current curriculum vitae (If applicable, explain any career interruptions that might have affected research productivity);
* A concise description of current and future research plans
* A sample of three key publications
* The name and contact information of three referees. These referees may be asked by the University to provide letters of reference.

For further information on this position, applicants may contact the dean's executive assistant melissa.picard@uoit.ca. The recruitment committee will start reviewing applications and conducting interviews on September 10 and until a successful candidate is selected.
