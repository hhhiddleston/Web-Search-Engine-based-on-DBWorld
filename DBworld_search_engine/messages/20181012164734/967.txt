*CALL FOR PAPERS*

NCA is a successful series of conferences that serves as a large international forum for presenting and sharing recent research
results and technological developments in the fields of Network and Cloud Computing. NCA, which is sponsored by the IEEE Computer
Society, reaches out to both researchers and practitioners, and to both academia and industry. The conference features keynotes,
technical presentations, and workshops.

The IEEE International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA) is seeking articles concerning fundamental research
and practical experience reports. 

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Theory of Network Computing
- Autonomic Network Computing
- Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- High Speed Networks/Protocols and Middleware
- Routing Mechanisms
- Overlay Networks/Peer-to-Peer Systems
- System Area Networks (SAN)/Clusters
- Performance Modeling/Quality of Services (QoS) Issues
- Web Caching and Switching
- Dependable Wide, Local, and System Area Networks
- Network Security
- Intrusion-Tolerant Networked Systems
- Scalable and Dependable Servers and Data Centers
- Middleware for Dependable Network Computing
- Self* (Configuring, Healing, Optimizing, Protecting, Organizing, Aware)
- Platforms for Network Computing
- Network Protocols: Verification and Validation
- Autonomic Network Computing for Achieving Self* Properties and Applications Availability
- Seamless and Virtual Capabilities for Implementing Self* Properties 
- Software Defined Networking (SDN): Principles and Implementation
- Designing Highly-Available and Secure SDN
- Network Functions Virtualization (NFV): Design and Optimization 
- Network Cloud Computing
- Machine Learning Techniques for Cloud Resources Management 
- Big Data in Clouds for IoT
- Future Internet and Communicating Objects 
- Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANET)
- Sensor Networks
- Fog/Edge Computing

*MANUSCRIPT SUBMISSIONS*

Submission and Submission Requirements:

Paper submissions are managed through EasyChair. Please visit the submission link to send your manuscript: 
http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nca2018

Submitted manuscripts must not have been previously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere and must be
cleared for publication in the NCA Proceedings, which will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. The manuscript
must be written in English, and must not exceed 8 pages for NCA papers or 4 pages for workshop papers. The submission must
be in PDF format. Instructions for submitting the manuscript are available at www.ieee-nca.org.


Manuscript page limit:

Regular Papers: 8 pages, including all figures, tables, and references.
Short Papers: 4 pages, including all figures, tables, and references.


Purchasing extra pages:

Regular Papers: Up to 2 extra pages may be purchased at $100 (US dollars) per extra page.
Short Papers: Up to 1 extra page may be purchased at $100 (US dollars).

Authors can decide to submit papers longer than 8/4 pages (up to 10 and 5, depending on the category) before the reviewing
process. This is an indication of their will to purchase extra pages during the registration process. Therefore, longer 
papers cannot be shrunk when preparing camera ready versions, in case of acceptance. This is to respect the work made by
reviewers and other authors who decided to stay in the limits.


*ACCEPTED PAPERS AND PUBLICATION POLICIES*

Every regular paper accepted must have attached to it at least one registration at the full (member or non-member) rate. Thus,
for a manuscript for which all authors are students, one student author will be required to register at the full registration
rate. For manuscripts where at least one author is already registered at the full rate, this fulfills the obligation for up to
two (2) papers.

No-show papers are defined as papers submitted by authors who subsequently did not present the paper in-person (no videos, no
remote cast will be allowed) at the technical meeting. Presentations by proxies are not allowed, unless explicitly approved 
*before* the conference by the technical co-chairs. No-show papers that were not withdrawn and were published in the Proceedings
must be identified as "No-Show" in the files submitted to IEEE for further publication (IEEE Xplore). No-shows will not be 
available on IEEE Xplore or other public access IEEE forums. IEEE will maintain an archive of no-shows.

Exceptions to this policy will be made by the Technical Program Chair of the conference only if there is evidence that the 
no-show occurred because of unanticipated events beyond the control of the authors, and every option available to the authors to 
present the paper was exhausted.

The IEEE strongly discourages changes and, in particular, withdrawals of papers once submitted and included in the program. To
avoid the likelihood of this, the author is strongly encouraged to get all necessary company and/or government approvals prior
to submitting his/her paper to the conference.

If under any circumstances it becomes necessary for the author to withdraw or change a paper, IEEE policy dictates that the 
request to do this must come directly from the author and not from any third party. IEEE policy also states that in this case,
the author will be held liable for all costs that are incurred. It would then be up to the author to get reimbursed for the 
expense from any third party if he/she feels it is justified. The IEEE cannot act as a policing entity on behalf of the author in
this regard.


*BEST PAPER AWARDS*

The IEEE NCA2018 Program Committee will select Best Paper and Best Student Paper. The first author of the Best Student Paper must
be a PhD student. Authors of high-quality papers that have been accepted to the main conference, will be invited to submit an 
extended version of their work to a special issue organized in an IEEE Journal.
