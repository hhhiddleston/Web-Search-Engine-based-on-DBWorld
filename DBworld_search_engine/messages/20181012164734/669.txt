--------------------------------------------------------------------

The mission of the Joint International Semantic Technology Conference (JIST) 
is to bring together researchers in the Semantic Technology research 
community and other areas of semantic-related technologies to present their 
innovative research results or novel applications of semantic technologies.

There are two tracks in JIST 2018 for Regular Technical Papers.


*** Research Track ***

JIST 2018 research track solicits submissions of original research work on 
semantic technologies. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

 -Ontology and reasoning
 -Knowledge graph
 -Linked Data
 -Big Data and semantics, exchange and integration
 -Data streams and the Internet of Things
 -Machine learning and information extraction on the Semantic Web
 -Semantic Web services and processes
 -Trust, privacy, and security on the Semantic Web
 -Social Semantic Web
 -Natural language processing and semantics
 -Semantic multimedia
 -Novel applications of semantic technologies

*** Special Session Track ***

JIST 2018 special session track to discover and implement special topics 
that researchers in Semantic Technology are particularly interested in. 
We also intend to facilitate participation of potentially-related researchers 
in the JIST conference. 

Topics of special sessions are as follows:

 - Special Session on Government Open Data
     http://jist2018.knowledge-graph.jp/pages/calls/government_open_data.html

 - Special Session on Question Answering and ChatBots
     http://jist2018.knowledge-graph.jp/pages/calls/qa_chatbots.html

 - Special Session on Resource-aware Semantic Technologies

*** Submission ***

Submissions to JIST 2018 should describe original, significant research on 
semantic technologies. JIST 2018 will not accept submissions that are under 
review for or have already been published in or accepted for publication in 
a journal or another conference (*). 
* Non peer-reviewed documents such as theses, tech reports, publications on 
preprint server (e.g. arXiv.org) are not considered prior publications. Thus 
 JIST2018 authors are not precluded to submit papers on the same topic by the 
same authors.

Submissions to JIST 2018 are expected to present their claimed contribution, 
with clear evidence to support their claims. 

All submissions will be critically reviewed by at least three members of the 
program committee of either research track or special session track. 
To assess submissions, reviewers will judge their relevance to semantic 
technologies, their originality, the technical soundness of their proposed 
approach and the readability of the submission.

JIST 2018 submissions are not anonymous.

Submissions must be in PDF format, using the style of the Springer Publications 
format for Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). 
Regular paper submissions must be no longer than 16 pages, and short paper 
submissions must be no longer than 8 pages. 
Submissions that exceed this limit may be rejected without review.

Accepted papers of both research track and special session track will be published 
in an LNCS proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must register 
for the conference and present the paper there.

Papers can be submitted electronically via EasyChair.

 * Please select the corresponding track(s) when you submit your paper(s).


*** Recommendation to Journal ***

A number of best papers accepted at JIST 2018 will be invited to present at the Meet 
the Editor session of SCI indexed journals, including International Journal on 
Semantic Web and Information Systems (IJSWIS), for fast-track publication in a special 
issue in these journals. Up to five papers will be selected and published.
