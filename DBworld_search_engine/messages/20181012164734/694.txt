Even though Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) is an established field, Educational and Knowledge Technologies (EKT) is the new multimediaâ€driven learning. Indeed the process of digitization is progressing quickly and a current hype in the Silicon Valley is mobile and personalized learning. The driver and enabler of this movement is on the one side the development and widespread availability of multimedia materials and MOOCs, which represent multimedia content produced specifically for supporting onlineâ€learning; and, on the other side, by the ever increasing availability of all sorts of information on the Internet and in social media channels (e.g. lectures, research papers, userâ€generated videos, news items), which, despite not directly targeting onlineâ€learning, can prove to be valuable complements to the more targeted learning materials. Although the availability of such content is not a problem these days, finding the right content and associating different relevant pieces of multimedia so as to enable a comprehensive learning experience on a chosen subject is by no means a trivial task.
