New forms of multimedia data (such as text, numbers, tags, networking, signals, geo-tagged information, graphs/relationships, 3D/VR/AR and sensor data, etc.)  has emerged in many applications in addition to traditional multimedia data (image, video, audio). Multimedia has become the biggest of big data as the foundation of today's data-driven discoveries. Almost all disciplines of  science and engineering, as well as social sciences, involve multimedia data in some forms, such as recording experiments, driverless cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, smart communities, biomedical instruments, security surveillance.  Some recent events demonstrate the power of real-time broadcast of unfolding events on social networks. Multimedia data is not just big in volume, but also multi-modal and mostly unstructured. Storing, indexing, searching, integrating, and recognizing from the vast amounts of data create unprecedented challenges. Even though significant progress has been made processing multimedia data, today's solutions are inadequate in handling data from millions of sources simultaneously. 

The IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Information Processing and Retrieval (IEEE-MIPR) aims to provide a forum for original research contributions and practical system design, implementation, and applications of multimedia information processing and retrieval for single modality or multiple modalities. The target audiences will be university researchers, scientists, industry practitioners, software engineers, and graduate students who need to become acquainted with technologies for big data analytics, machine intelligence, information fusion in multimedia information processing and retrieval.  A collection of keynotes, and workshops will be held, together  with paper/poster sessions. In addition, MIPR 2019 Innovation Forum invites leaders in multimedia society to discuss the topics covering video compression, display Technology, NLP/Audio Technology, Computer Vision, AR/VR, and Autonomous Driving.

The conference will accept regular papers (6 pages), short papers (4 pages), and demo papers (4 pages). Authors are encouraged to compare their approaches, qualitatively or quantitatively, with existing work and explain the strength and weakness of the new approaches. Selected submissions will be invited to submit to journal special issues.
