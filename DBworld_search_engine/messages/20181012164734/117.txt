=======================
12th WISTP International Conference on Information Security Theory and Practice (WISTP 2018)
Brussels, Belgium -- 10-11 December 2018

http://www.wistp.org/

Deadline for submissions: 1 October 2018
 
Future ICT technologies, such as the concepts of Ambient Intelligence, Cyber-physical Systems, and Internet of Things provide a vision of the Information Society in which: a) people and physical systems are surrounded with intelligent interactive interfaces and objects, and b) environments are capable of recognising and reacting to the presence of different individuals or events in a seamless, unobtrusive, and invisible manner. The success of future ICT technologies will depend on how secure these systems are and to what extent they protect the privacy of individuals and individuals trust them.

The 12th WISTP International Conference on Information Security Theory and Practice (WISTP'2018) seeks original submissions from academia and industry presenting novel research on all theoretical and practical aspects of security and privacy, as well as experimental studies of fielded systems, the application of security technology, the implementation of systems, and lessons learned. We encourage submissions from other communities such as law, business, and policy that present these communities' perspectives

IMPORTANT DATES
---------------

Deadline for paper submission: October 1st, 2018 (11:59 p.m. AOE)
Notification to authors: November 5th, 2018
Author Registration: November 15th, 2018
Camera-ready version: December 2nd, 2018


Submission Instructions
-----------------------
Submissions must not substantially overlap papers that                                       have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or conference/workshop with proceedings. Each submission should be at most 16 pages in total in the Springerâ€™s LNCS format. All submissions should be anonymous (i.e., no author names/affiliations and obvious citations).
Submissions are to be made to the submission web site: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wistp2018

Only PDF files will be accepted. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. Accepted papers will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series, and the proceedings will be available at the conference. The camera-ready version of the accepted papers must follow Springer guidelines (a Latex source file will be required). 

If a submitted paper is mainly the work of a student author, this paper is eligible for the best student paper award. To participate in this selection process, please add the word "STUDENT" in the affiliation field in the submission form.

Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register with the conference and present the paper. For authors presenting multiple papers, one normal registration is valid for up to two papers.

Scientific supports
-------------------
- IFIP WG 11.2 Pervasive Systems Security

Journal Information Sponsorship
-------------------------------
- Information (an Open Access Journal by MDPI) will offer to main authors of Best Paper and Best Student Paper to waive the fee for a future publication in the journal.

Main author of accepted papers will receive a 200â‚¬ voucher for a future publication in the journal.

Note this offer is not related to an extended version of the presented papers. It can be any article from the main author. This submission will go through the whole reviewing process of the journal which is completely independent to WISTP.
