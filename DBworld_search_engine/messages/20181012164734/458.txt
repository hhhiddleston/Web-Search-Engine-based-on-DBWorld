Digital Ecosystems of the Future: Methods, Techniques and Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Call for Papers
***************
For 40 years, the GI Special Interest Group on Design Methods for Information System (GI-SIG-EMISA) has been a platform for industry experts and academics to exchange and discuss the methodical aspects of planning, modeling, developing and running digital ecosystems. While terminology and buzzwords change, many of the questions raised when EMISA was founded still remain challenging, and many new questions came along over the years.

The EMISA 2019 conference celebrates the 40 years anniversary of the EMISA conference series at the location of its inaugural meeting in 1979, the “Evangelische Akademie” in Tutzing, Germany (near Munich). Located beautifully right next to Lake Starnberg, the “Evangelische Akademie” links modern accommodation with a stunning scenery and features the fantastic “Rotunde” room which provokes lively and intensive discussions.  

The EMISA 2019 Conference Chairs invite original submissions not under review elsewhere: Full papers of a maximum length of 14 pages and short papers of 8 pages. In addition, we invite the research groups involved in GI-SIG-EMISA to present their current research and projects in an innovative exhibition. Short papers (max. 8 pages) of exhibitors will be published as well; a plenary “EMISA 2019 Madness” will allow each group for inviting the audience to its exhibition stand. 

The EMISA 2019 program will also feature keynotes by personalities who have substantially contributed to GI-SIG-EMISA in the past 40 years.
