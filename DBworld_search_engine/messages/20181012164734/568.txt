Cyber-physical systems (CPS) interact with the physical world, and their operations are monitored, coordinated, controlled and integrated by various information and communication technologies. As CPS become common, and range in size, complexity and criticality, from embedded systems used in home automation, smart vehicles, smart grids, water distribution systems, smart transportation systems, to Industrial Internet of Things. 

As CPS become ubiquitous, and increasingly interact with users, other systems and affect our life, their security becomes important. It also opens up new threats and attack vectors such as data exfil, denial of service, espionage, privacy and security violations. Possible defensive solutions can be developed using Artificial Intelligence and data analytics systems that detect, remediate, and provide forensic capabilities. Such AI based cyber defense systems can help augment a security analystâ€™s workflow and provide security orchestration capabilities.  

The Workshop on Analytics for Security in Cyber Physical Systems - 2019 is dedicated to addressing the role of AI & analytics in cybersecurity in the increasingly dynamic landscape of cyber threats in several pervasive areas such as, but not limited to, mobile networks, IoT, Transportation, and automobiles. The workshop program will have world-renowned speakers from research institutes, government agencies and industry. This workshop will provide a forum to bring together researchers discussing advanced methods in data analytics for cybersecurity and will deal with practical applications where these can be used. The goal of this workshop is to bring together the state of the art research in cybersecurity, AI, and Analytics in the context of new threats and challenges in the context of cyber physical systems. Papers in all topics related to analytics in cybersecurity are invited.

Research topics included, but not limited to:

Cybersecurity AI & analytics in wireless mobile networks
Cybersecurity AI & analytics in Financial Services
Cybersecurity AI & analytics in Transportation
Cybersecurity AI & analytics in implantable medical devices
Cybersecurity AI &  analytics  in cyber-physical systems
