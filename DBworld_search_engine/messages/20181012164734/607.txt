== ABOUT THE WORKSHOP

DPM is an annual international workshop covering research in data privacy 
management. Organizations are increasingly concerned about the privacy of 
information that they manage (as witnessed, for example, by lawsuits filed 
against organizations for violating the privacy of customer's data). Thus, 
the management of privacy-sensitive information is very critical and important 
for every organization. This poses several challenging problems, such as how 
to translate the high-level business goals into system-level privacy policies, 
administration of privacy-sensitive data, privacy preserving data integration 
and engineering, privacy preserving access control mechanisms, information-oriented 
security, and query execution on privacy-sensitive data for partial answers. 
Starting from these observations, the aim of DPM is to discuss and exchange 
ideas related to data privacy management

DPM 2018 is the thirteenth workshop in this series and will be held
in Barcelona, Spain, in conjunction with the 23rd European 
Symposium On Research in Computer Security (ESORICS 2018).

The workshop will be a 1.5-day event, featuring technical presentations of 11 
full papers and 5 short papers, and one keynote speech from Sarah Meiklejohn 
(University College London).
