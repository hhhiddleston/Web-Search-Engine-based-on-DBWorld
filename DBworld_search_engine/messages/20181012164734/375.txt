IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PROCESS MINING (ICPM)

Aachen (Germany), 24-28 June 2019

CALL FOR PAPERS

The IEEE International Conference on Process Mining (ICPM) aims to become the premium forum for researchers, practitioners and developers in process mining. The objective is to explore and exchange knowledge in this field through scientific talks, industry discussions, contests, technical tutorials and panels. The conference covers all aspects of process mining research and practice, including theory, algorithmic challenges, applications and the connection with other fields. 

Process mining is an innovative research field which focusses on extracting business process insights from transactional data commonly recorded by IT systems, with the ultimate goal of analyzing and improving organizational productivity along performance dimensions such as efficiency, quality, compliance and risk. By relying on data rather than perceptions gained from interviews and workshops, process mining shifts the way of thinking from “confidence-based” to “evidence-based” business process management. Thus, process mining distinguishes itself within the information systems domain by its fundamental, evidence-based focus on understanding, analyzing, and improving business processes. 
Compared with other data-driven research areas such as machine learning or data mining, process mining differs in the fundamental assumptions that data is generated in the context of more or less structured processes, and that the data contains explicit references to instances of these processes. Another key difference with other data-analysis techniques is that analysis results have to be explained in the context of these (interacting) processes.

Current process mining challenges include scalability, i.e. dealing with volume, velocity and variability of input data, especially in real-time/online settings using event streams; approximation, i.e. balancing computation time with accuracy; understandability and explainability, i.e. providing easy-to-understand and explainable analytics; multi-perspective analysis, i.e. considering data, resources and time beyond the process control flow; measurability, e.g., providing a comprehensive framework for measuring differences between observed and modelled process behavior, and ethical aspects of process mining, i.e. how to ensure that process mining procedures and results do not violate ethical principles.

ICPM 2019 will take place in Aachen, Germany, under the auspices of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society, and supported by the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining. Aachen, a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, is well-known for its historic old-town center and the lively student life. Aachen offers many places of interest, including Aachen Cathedral in the heart of the city. The building was completed at the end of the 8th century by Emperor Charlemagne and became the first UNESCO World Heritage site in Germany. The Elisenbrunnen fountain represents Aachen as a spa and bathing city. Not only the Romans appreciated these hot springs, but also Charlemagne. ICPM will be co-located with the 40th International Conference on Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency (Petri Nets 2019), and the 19th IEEE International Conference on Application of Concurrency to System Design (ACSD 2019). The three events will take place in the conference area of the Tivoli football stadium close to the Aachen’s city center.

ICPM 2019 encourages papers on new techniques and applications for process mining, as well as case studies coming from industrial scenarios. Also, papers describing novel process mining tools are expected. For new techniques, the availability of an implementation (which has to be accessible by the reviewers) is essential. Authors are expected to provide insights into the performance of new techniques on established, publicly-available benchmark datasets, or to release their datasets for replicability purposes. Empirical papers should build, where possible, on novel datasets previously unpublished, while research on existing datasets must clearly explain the novelty of the applied analysis.

The thematic areas in which contributions are sought include, but are not limited to, those listed below. 
Process mining techniques:
 - Automated discovery of process models

 - Construction of event logs
 - Improving quality of event logs
 - Decision mining for processes

 - Simulation/optimization and process mining
 - Predictive process analytics
 - Prescriptive process analytics and recommender systems 
 - Privacy, security and ethics
 - Process model repair

 - Resource Management
 - Risk Management
 - Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
 - Sensors, Internet-of-Things (IoT) and wearable devices
 - Specific domains such as accounting, finance, government, healthcare, manufacturing

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Submissions must be original contributions that have not been published previously, nor submitted elsewhere while being submitted to ICPM 2019. 

All files must be prepared using the latest IEEE Computational Intelligence Society conference proceedings guidelines (8.5” × 11” two-column format). The page limit for regular papers is 8 pages. All papers must be in English. In addition to regular submissions, there will be a tools section. Tools will be presented at the conference in an interactive session. Related papers will describe a tool, its functionality and interfaces as well as the underlying algorithms and implementation aspects. These tool papers are limited to 4 pages. 

Conference proceedings will be submitted for inclusion to IEEE Xplore. Accepted regular and tool papers will be included in the conference proceedings. At least one author of each accepted contribution is expected to present the paper or tool at the conference, and required to sign a copyright release form. 

All papers are to be submitted via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf= icpm2019. Selected papers will be considered for publication in extended and revised form in a special issue of an international journal.
