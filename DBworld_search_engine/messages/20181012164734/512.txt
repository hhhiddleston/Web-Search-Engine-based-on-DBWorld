WiMob is an international forum for the exchange of knowledge and
experience among researchers, developers and practitioners of wireless and
mobile technology. For fourteen years, the International WiMob conference
has provided unique opportunities for researchers and developers to interact,
share new results, show live demonstrations, and discuss emerging directions
in a number of contemporary topics in wireless and mobile computing.

WiMob 2018 is soliciting high quality technical papers addressing research
challenges in the areas of wireless communications, wireless networking,
mobility, nomadicity, ubiquitous computing, services and applications.
Papers should present original work validated via analysis, simulation or
experimentation. Practical experiences and Testbed trials also are welcome.


TOPICS

WiMob 2018 will host 5 parallel symposia on:

¥ Wireless Communications
¥ Wireless Networking, Mobility and Nomadicity
¥ Ubiquitous Computing, Services and Applications
¥ Green and Sustainable Communications and Network Computing
¥ Security on Wireless and Mobile Networks

A full list of topics for each symposium can be found on the conference
web site.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSION

All short paper submissions should be written in English conforming to the
IEEE standard conference format (8.5" x 11" - US letter, Two-Column) with
a maximum paper length of 4 pages. They should be fully formatted, with
graphs, images and other special areas arranged as intended for the final
publication. The short papers will be included in the conference proceedings,
published by IEEE CS Press (IEEE Xplore) and indexed by Scopus and Ei
Compendex.

Participants submitting posters or demos are required to submit a short
paper describing the poster/demo content, the research supporting it, and
the relevance and importance to WiMob.

Accepted papers must be presented at the conference. At least one author of
each accepted paper must register to the conference, by the early date
indicated by the organizers, and present the paper.

During the conference, posters and demos will be displayed or presented in
specified sessions. The recommended display poster size is A1 (594mm by
841mm, portrait). Demo submissions may include an additional 1-page
appendix describing the specific contents of the demo that conference
attendees would see. Any special technical requirements for the demo
should also be described in this appendix. The contents of this appendix
will be used to evaluate whether the demo is a good fit for WiMob 2018,
but will not be included in the proceedings.

Only timely submissions through EDAS at https://edas.info will be accepted.
