[Important Dates]
    - Paper Submission Deadline: September 23, 2018
    - Notification of Acceptance: October 27, 2018
    - Deadline for Camera-ready papers: November 15, 2018
    - Deadline for Workshop Author Registration: November 15, 2018
    - Workshop Day: December 3-6, 2018

All BHI workshop papers will be published in the main conference proceedings. The proceedings is indexed in PubMed (NLM ID is 101525347).

In order to solicit high-quality papers and increase the number of submissions to the 2017 Workshop on Biomedical and Health Informatics, the workshop organizer will allow authors to have their best work published in a more extended format. The workshop organizer will select a small number of manuscripts submitted to the workshop for possible publication based on the reviews by the workshop program committee.

[Description of the topics]
    The goal of biomedical and health informatics is to advance biomedicine and healthcare using information technologies. One of fundamental issues that healthcare/biomedical researchers encounter today is how to make use of the enormous amount of electronic healthcare/biomedical data. Healthcare knowledge discovery from the data holds great promise to improve the quality of patient care, prevent potential medical errors, and reduce healthcare cost. In addition, this may enable the practices of medicine to be (healthcare) data-driven and accelerate evidence-based medicine. Establishing a methodology for knowledge discovery and management of large amounts of health/biomedical data has therefore become a main priority in health informatics and biomedicine. To accomplish this objective, both practical applications and theoretical research will be essential.

Organized in conjunction with BIBM 2016, the goal of this workshop is to attract various researchers from both computer science, information science, biomedical informatics, biomedicine, and healthcare for sharing and exchanging their awareness of current research issues, technologies, and ideas. Papers are welcome from the following topics (but not limited to):
   - Foundations of biomedicine and health informatics
   - Health information technology (HIT)
   - Evidence-based medical practice using HIT
   - Medical imaging informatics
   - Electronic health/medical record applications
   - Personal health record applications
   - Healthcare data warehouses
   - Human-computer interaction and usability in healthcare
   - Clinical Workflow and Human Factors
   - Health information modeling and sharing
   - Biomedical/Health database integration and management
   - Health Information retrieval and extraction
   - Research on MEDLINE/PubMed
   - Linguistic and semantic resources including dictionary and ontology
   - Extraction of functional information from biomedical literature
   - Biomedical ontology applications
   - Computer-aided annotation
   - Personalized medicine and drug discovery
   - Data/Text mining in biomedicine/healthcare
   - Lessons learned from health information system implementation
   - Nursing Informatics
   - Clinical decision support
   - Healthcare IT Standards
   - Translational bioinformatics and biomedicine
   - Data/Text mining for precision medicine
