INTRODUCTION
==============
Welcome to participate in DependSys 2018, Melbourne, Australia, December 11-13, 2018! The DependSys 2018 symposium in the 4th event, which is a timely event bringing together new ideas, techniques, and solutions for dependability and its issues in sensor, cloud, and big data systems and applications. The first event (DependSys 2015) was held in Zhangjiajie, China, which was of a great success. As we are deep into the Information Age, we witness the explosive growth of data available on the Internet. Human beings are producing quintillion bytes of data every day, which come from sensors, individual archives, social networks, Internet of Things, enterprise and Internet in all scales and formats. One of the most challenging issues we face in achieving designed system performance to an expected level, i.e., how to effectively provide dependability in sensor, cloud, and big data systems. These systems need to typically run continuously, which often tend to become inert, brittle, and vulnerable after a while. We can observe that this trend is further stimulated by an ever-increasing cost pressure. 

The focus of DependSys 2018 is to create a forum for individuals, academics, practitioners, and organizations, who are developing or procuring sophisticated computer systems on whose dependability of services they need to place great confidence. Future systems need to close the dependability gap in face of challenges in different circumstances. The emphasis will be on differing properties of such services, e.g., continuity, effective performance, real-time responsiveness, ability to overcome data fault/corruption/anomaly, ability to avoid catastrophic failures, prevention of deliberate privacy intrusions, reliability, availability, sustainability, adaptability, heterogeneity, security, safety, and so on.
