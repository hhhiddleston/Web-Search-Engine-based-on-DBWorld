Introduction
     
The SpaCCS 2018 conference is the 11th event in the series of conferences which are devoted to security, privacy and anonymity in computation, communication and storage. SpaCCS is now recognized as the main regular event of the world that is covering many dimensions including security algorithms and architectures, privacy-aware policies, regulations and techniques, anonymous computation and communication, encompassing fundamental theoretical approaches, practical experimental projects, and commercial application systems for computation, communication and storage. As applications of computer systems and networks have permeated in every aspect of our daily life, the issues of security, privacy, and anonymity have become increasingly critical. The conference will provide a forum for the world-class researchers to gather and share their research achievements, emerging ideas and trends in the highly challenging research fields.  

The conference aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners in the world working in the research fields of computation, communication and storage, with regard to security, privacy, and anonymity aspects of computer systems and networks. SpaCCS will focus on three broad areas of computation, communication, and storage, i.e. architectures, algorithms, techniques, and applications for security, privacy and anonymity.

Submission Guidelines
Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Papers must be clearly presented in English, must not exceed 14 pages in Springer LNCS format (or up to 18 pages with the pages over length charge), including tables, figures, references and appendices. Papers will be selected based on their originality, significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation assessed by at least two reviewers. Submission of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present the work. All accepted papers will be published by Springer LNCS (EI Indexed). Two outstanding papers will be selected to receive the Best Paper Awards.
