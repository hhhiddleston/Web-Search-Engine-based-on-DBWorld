       Goodtechs 18

       4th EAI International Conference on
       Smart Objects and Technologies for Social Good
       Special Session on Serious Games to Improve Quality of Life

       CALL FOR PAPERS

Gamification techniques and serious games are often used to capture and maintain user's attention. This is particularly important when dealing with young patients or people with special needs.
Patient's collaboration is crucial for doctors to perform a good diagnosis, and to provide an efficient therapy, but it cannot always be taken for granted. Moreover, serious games are proved to be an efficient tool to incentivize people to improve their lifestyle, e.g., making more physical activity.
This track will feature new insights, research, and practice on how to design, develop and use gamification and persuasive technologies to create serious games and applications to improve individuals' Quality of Life (QoL) and behavior, with a particular focus on people with disabilities.
The track targets researchers, doctoral students, practitioners and other people interested in presenting, discussing, reflecting and networking on central themes associated with the development and use of serious games and applications to help people with special needs.
Papers on both theoretical aspects and design method of gamification techniques and serious games are welcomed, which describe and evaluate novel design methods and system prototypes. In addition, the track welcomes full research and work in progress papers and educational cases.

GoodTechs 18 will be held in Bologna, Italy, from the 28th to 30th of Novembre 2018.
