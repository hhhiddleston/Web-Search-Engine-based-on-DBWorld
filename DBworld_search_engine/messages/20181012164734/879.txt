GENERAL SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Authors are invited to submit their research work to the CloudCom 2018
conference. Submitted work must not substantially overlap papers that
have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a
conference with proceedings. Authors must submit their work by 31 August,
2018 using the EasyChair submission system:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cloudcom2018 .

Only PDF files will be accepted. Manuscripts need to be prepared according to
the IEEE CS format (https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html).


CALL FOR SHORT PAPERS, POSTERS & DEMOS (Late-breaking Results)

All short paper submissions should be written in English with a maximum
paper length of 4 pages. The short papers will be included in the conference
proceedings, published by IEEE CS Press (IEEE Xplore) and indexed by EI and
ISSN.

Participants submitting posters or demos are required to submit a short
paper describing the poster/demo content, the research supporting it, and
the relevance and importance to the Cloud Computing Association.

Accepted papers must be presented at the conference. At least one author of
each accepted paper must register to the conference, by the early date
indicated by the organizers, and present the paper.

During the conference, posters and demos will be displayed or presented in
specified sessions. The recommended display poster size is A1 (594mm by
841mm, portrait). Demo submissions may include an additional 1-page
appendix describing the specific contents of the demo that conference
attendees would see. Any special technical requirements for the demo
should also be described in this appendix. The contents of this appendix
will be used to evaluate whether the demo is a good fit for CloudCom 2018,
but will not be included in the proceedings.


CALL FOR PH.D. CONSORTIUM

A Ph.D. consortium will be held in conjunction with IEEE CloudCom 2018.
The Ph.D. consortium aims to provide an opportunity for Ph.D. students in
the early stage of their dissertation and Master students planning to advance
their study in a doctoral program to present their research results and receive
feedback from experienced scholars and industry experts. Accepted Ph.D.
consortium papers will be published in the Proceedings of IEEE CloudCom
2018 and archived in IEEE Xplore.
