Process management technology has contributed to the advancement of process-aware enterprise 
information systems (PAIS) for more than a decade. Modern companies have adopted research 
results from the business process management (BPM) field to keep pace with the challenges 
emerging due to increasing customer demands. Meanwhile, Millennials have fanned the use of 
mobile technology in everyday life, as well as for many businesses. Consequently, enterprises 
need to enhance their process-aware information systems to properly integrate smart mobile 
devices in a flexible and cost-effective way. Along this trend, the sensor capabilities of 
mobile devices have increased by magnitude of orders enabling an advanced support of business 
processes and their activities. In the era of the Internet of Things, in addition, numerous 
sensors emerged that are used ubiquitously in everyday business on a cheap and effective basis. 
Especially in the light of Industry 4.0 and cyber-physical systems, manufacturers crave for the 
integration of sensor technology and sensor data with their process-aware information systems. As 
the latter provide a well-defined context, the context-aware integration of sensors and sensor 
data becomes powerfully possible.

The aim of this Special Issue is to investigate upcoming challenges, research opportunities, and 
technologies emerging along the described trends. In particular, the Special Issue shall investigate:

-The impact of considering sensor data on the various stages of the business process lifecycle, i.e., 
 modeling, implementation and configuration, deployment, enactment, monitoring, dynamic adaptation, mining 
 and evolution of business processes.
-The impact of considering business processes on the way sensors systems and networks are built or 
 reorganized.

This Special Issue aims to provide a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art sensor technology in the light 
of business process management. We invite research articles that will consolidate the understanding of the 
state-of-the-art in this area. The Special Issue will publish full research, review, and highly rated 
manuscripts on the integration of process technology with sensor data, addressing—amongst others—one of 
the following topics:

* Sensor-enriched process tasks
* Sensor data processing and event management
* System architectures
* Wearables and mobile sensors
* Sensor categories and their relevance for business process support
* Resource tracking and management (e.g., humans vs. robots)
* Sensor- and context-driven processes
* Virtual and augmented reality support for business processes / tasks
* Aligning digital processes with processes from the physical world
* Predictive processes based on sensor data
* Sensor-based detection of discrepancies between digital and real process
* Business process support in the era of the Internet/Web of Things
* Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things
* Sensor-based exception discovery and handling
* Equipping process resources (incl. humans) with sensors
* Combining process mining with sensor data support

About MDPI Sensors
=====================================================================================
Sensors (ISSN 1424-8220) provides an advanced forum for the science and technology of 
sensors and biosensors. It publishes reviews (including comprehensive reviews on the 
complete sensors products), regular research papers and short notes. Our aim is to encourage 
scientists to publish their experimental and theoretical results in as much detail as 
possible. There is no restriction on the length of the papers. The full experimental 
details must be provided so that the results can be reproduced.

Submission Guidelines
=====================================================================================

Manuscripts should be submitted online at www.mdpi.com by registering and 
logging in to this website. Once you are registered, click here to go to the 
submission form. Manuscripts can be submitted until the deadline. All papers 
will be peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the 
journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue 
website. Research articles, review articles as well as short communications are 
invited. For planned papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words) can 
be sent to the Editorial Office for announcement on this website.

Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under 
consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference proceedings papers). 
All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a single-blind peer-review 
process. A guide for authors and other relevant information for submission 
of manuscripts is available on the Instructions for Authors page. Sensors is an 
international peer-reviewed open access monthly journal published by MDPI.

Please visit the Instructions for Authors page before submitting a manuscript. 
The Article Processing Charge (APC) for publication in this open access journal 
is 1800 CHF (Swiss Francs). Submitted papers should be well formatted and use good 
English. Authors may use MDPI's English editing service prior to publication or 
during author revisions.
