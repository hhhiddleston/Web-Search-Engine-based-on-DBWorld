Crime prevention and timely aid to victims of criminal acts are challenging tasks for administrators and citizens, and   become increasingly complex with the advances in technology used by perpetrators of crimes. Using technological innovations to proactively predict and prevent crime, and to provide timely aid to victims, is the need of the times. Recently, social networking and cloud computing have been a witness to the execution of many criminal activities, providing powerful and easy mechanisms for the criminals to confer, plan and execute with absolute timely precision. IoTs are highly vulnerable to becoming the criminalâ€™s playground as well, due to the absence of heavy access control and standardized security mechanisms.
On the other hand, with proper policies and mechanisms, and cloud based fast analytics, IoT devices can be not only made secure, they could also be tailored to play a prominent role in crime prevention.The scope for successful use of IoT in crime prevention arises from three aspects of their inherent nature, geographic coverage and universality, connectivity, and control over associated entities appliances/vehicles.IoT devices would typically generate huge volumes of data. Massive data generated by the IoT devices needs to be stored, accessed fast, and an analyzed to get meaningful activities done. Cloud based storage, cloud computing and big data analytics are crucial technologies for making IoT technology useful, especially for objectives like crime prevention.
The First IEEE International Workshop on IoT and Cloud based Collaborative Analytics for Prevention of Crimes and Heinous Activities (I-CAPCHA 2018)  welcomes research efforts in this emerging area, and solicits research papers on ideas, models, surveys and applications in  the area.
Submission Guidelines
