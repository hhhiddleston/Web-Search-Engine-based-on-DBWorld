International Workshop on Graph Analytics (GA) affiliated with ICDM 2018

Website: https://gaworkshoppage.github.io

Graph model has been widely used in a variety of domains to model the connectedness among entities in real-world organizations and complex systems, such as social networks, communication networks, collaboration networks, e-commerce networks, biological networks, transportation networks, world wide web, and knowledge base. With the rapid development of information technologies in the last decades, the accumulated graph data are becoming larger and larger. The availability of rich graph data not only brings great opportunities for realizing big values of data to serve key applications but also brings great challenges in computation. To enable individuals, business, and organisations to exploit the value of big graph data, there is an increasing demand for novel graph analytics models as well as scalable graph analytics techniques and systems.

The workshop is co-located with the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2018).

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
Graph analytics techniques
Graph mining techniques
Evaluation measures for graphs
Machine learning techniques for graphs
Single-machine graph management Techniques
External-memory graph management Techniques
Distributed Graph Management Techniques
Graph analysis and management of multimedia databases
Graph analysis and management of semantic web data
Graph analysis and management of biomedical data
Graph analysis and management for geometrical applications
Graph analysis and management for business process management applications
Advanced applications and tools for graph analysis in different domains
