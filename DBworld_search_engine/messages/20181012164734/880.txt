The European Conference on Service-Oriented and Cloud Computing (ESOCC) is the premier conference on advances in the state of the art and practice of service-oriented computing and cloud computing in Europe. The main objectives of this conference are to facilitate the exchange between researchers and practitioners in the areas of service-oriented computing and cloud computing, as well as to explore the new trends in those areas and foster future collaborations in Europe and beyond.

As in the previous two ESOCC editions, ESOCC 2018 will include a special track entirely devoted to presenting results and perspectives of EU research projects on Service-Oriented and Cloud Computing.

The track session will be held on September 12, 2018. ESOCC 2018 EU projects track features a good opportunity for presenters to disseminate the results of their project and for participants to get an updated view of the ongoing research on Service-Oriented and Cloud Computing.
