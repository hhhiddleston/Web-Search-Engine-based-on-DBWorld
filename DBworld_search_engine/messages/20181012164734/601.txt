Aims and Scope
---------------
 
The technological and industrial revolution brought by the Internet of Things
(IoT) comes with new forms of threats and attacks that exploit the inherent
complexity and heterogeneity of IoT networks. There are many recent examples
of attacks that exploit IoT devices to perform large-scale distributed denial of
service attacks, to spy on people, and to hijack communication links, therefore
delivering full control of anything that is remotely accessible to an attacker. The
special session focuses on both the theoretical & practical aspects of the
security, privacy, and trust of IoT networks, devices, applications, and services as
well as novel ways of dealing with their vulnerabilities and mitigating
sophisticated cyber-attacks.

Topics of interest
-------------------
Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
* Blockchain applications in IoT
* Cyber-threat intelligence
* Game-theoretic security for IoT
* Identity management and access control for IoT
* IoT and cloud forensics
* Lightweight cryptography for IoT
* Malware detection and mitigation
* Network intrusion detection/mitigation
* Privacy and data protection in IoT
* Security in mobile applications
* System and data integrity
* Trust management for IoT
