BACKGROUND AND SCOPE
====================
In many application domains of recommender systems, it is highly important to consider the sequential order of past actions of a user in the recommendation process. For example, in e-commerce settings, it is often necessary to take the last few actions of a customer into account to understand their short-term shopping intents. Similarly, in music or video streaming applications, next-item or similar-item recommendations should match the userâ€™s ongoing listening or viewing session to provide a satisfying user experience. Besides such often purely session-based recommendation scenarios, there are, however, also domains where the userâ€™s longer-term interests have to be considered as well. The sequential recommendation of a Point-of-Interest (POI) to visit next during a trip, for example, should not only be based on the usersâ€™ current location or very last check-in at a POI, but also on their general traveling interests.

The described types of sequence-aware recommenders are usually based on sequential models, which are learned from time-ordered logs of user actions (e.g., item viewing or listening events, purchases, or user check-ins in social networks). However, these sequential logs not only allow to create models to adapt the recommendations to the userâ€™s current context; they also contain additional behavioural patterns that can be leveraged in the recommendation process. They, for example, allow to detect short-term popularity trends in the community and to learn repeated item purchase or consumption patterns. Such patterns have already been used in the literature to further improve the recommendations or to extend the scope of recommenders to reminders.
In recent years, we have observed an increased interest in session-based and sequential recommendation problems, which are highly relevant in practice but were underexplored in the academic literature for a long time. 

The goal of the special issue is to consolidate the current state of the art in the area and to report on recent advances in the areas of session-based and sequential recommendations.
