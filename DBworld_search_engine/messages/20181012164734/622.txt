IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management

Special Issue on Novel Techniques in Big Data Analytics for Management

http://www.comsoc.org/tnsm/cfp/si-bdm

(Submissions due: 15 November 2018)

Cloud and network analytics can harness the immense stream of operational data from clouds and networks, and can perform analytics processing to improve reliability, configuration, performance, fault and security management. In particular, we see a growing trend towards using statistical analysis, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning to improve operations and management of IT systems and networks.

Research is therefore needed to understand and improve the potential and suitability of Big Data analytics and AI in the context of systems and network management. This will not only provide deeper understanding and better decision making based on largely collected and available operational data, but present opportunities for improving data analysis algorithms and methods on aspects such as accuracy and scalability, as well as demonstrate the benefits of machine intelligence methods in system and network management and control. Moreover, there is an opportunity to define novel platforms that can harness the vast operational data and advanced data analysis algorithms to drive management decisions in networks, data centers, and clouds.

IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (IEEE TNSM) is a premier journal for timely publication of archival research on the management of networks, systems, services and applications. Following the success of two recent TNSM special issues on Big Data Analytics for Management in 2016 and 2018, this special issue will also focus on recent, emerging approaches and technical solutions that can exploit Big Data, analytics, and AI in management solutions. We welcome submissions addressing the underlying challenges of Big Data Analytics for Management and presenting novel techniques, experimental results, or theoretical approaches motivated by management problems. Survey papers that offer a perspective on related work and identify key challenges for future research are also in the scope of the special issue.
