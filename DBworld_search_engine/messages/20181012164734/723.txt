ï»¿Call for Tutorials 
EDBT/ICDT 2019 Joint Conference, Lisbon Portugal
March 26-29, 2019


We solicit proposals for tutorials for presentation at the EDBT/ICDT 2019 Joint Conference to be held in Lisbon, Portugal. Proposals must provide an in-depth survey of the selected topic with the option of describing specific works in depth. Proposals should include a meaningful summary of open issues in the area. The topic of the tutorial should be broad enough to attract a significant audience  and must include enough details to provide a sense of both the scope of the material to be covered and the depth to which it will be covered. 

**Submission Guidelines**


Tutorial proposals should be submitted by email, as a single PDF file to the Tutorial Chair, Irini Fundulaki (fundul@ics.forth.gr). The submission should not be more than 4 (four) pages long, in the ACM Proceedings Format.** Each submission should include the following information: 


1. Proposed Tutorial title
2. Preferred Duration (1.5 or 3 hours; if the tutorial can be of either length, please be sure to identify which material is included for each case)
3. Abstract
4. Outline presenting the scope and depth of the coverage of the topics to be addressed by the tutorial
5. Specific tutorial goals and objectives
6. Intended Audience and any prerequisite knowledge the audience must have
7. Short biography (no longer than a paragraph) of the speakers, including contact information
8. If an earlier version of the tutorial has been presented in a different venue, indicate those venues as well as the difference in the content with the other editions of the tutorial
