The Sixth Workshop on Data Mining in Biomedical Informatics and Healthcare (DMBIHÕ18)
http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/research/vc/ICDM18/index.html
Singapore, November 17-20, 2018
In conjunction with the IEEE ICDM 2018

The Sixth Workshop on Data Mining in Biomedical Informatics and Healthcare aims to 
provide a forum for data miners, informacists, data scientists, and clinical 
researchers to share their latest investigations in applying data mining techniques 
to biomedical and healthcare data. The increasing availability of large and complex 
data sets to the research community, triggers the need to develop more advanced and 
sophisticated data analytical techniques to exploit and manage these big data. The 
broader context of the workshop comprehends artificial intelligence, information 
retrieval, machine learning, and knowledge extraction methods using biomedical image 
analysis and natural language processing. Submissions are invited to address the 
need for developing new methods to mine, summarize and integrate the huge volume and 
diverse modalities of the structured and unstructured biomedical and healthcare data 
that can potentially lead to significant advances in the field. 

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
* Classifying and clustering big data in electronic health records (EHRs)
* Classifying and clustering temporal data in EHRs and biomedical data in high 
  dimensional spaces
* Application of deep learning methods to clinical data
* Topic modeling / detection in large amounts of clinical textual data
* Data preprocessing and cleansing to deal with noise and missing data in large 
  biomedical or population health data sets
* Algorithms to speed up the analysis of big biomedical data
* Novel visualization techniques to facilitate the query and analysis ofÊ clinical 
  data
* Statistics and probability in large-scale data mining
* Evidence-based medicine
* Medical image data mining
* HIPAA compliance data mining
* Pharmacogenomics data mining
* Biological markers detection
* Biological and clinical data analysis and integration for translational research
* Computational genetics, genomics and proteomics

Important Dates
* Papers Due: August 7, 2018
* Author Notifications: September 4, 2018
* Camera-ready deadline and copyright forms: September 15, 2018

Submission and Procedures
Paper submissions will be done through the IEEE ICDM Workshop CyberChair submission 
system. As per ICDM instructions, papers are limited to a maximum of eight pages, 
and follow the IEEE ICDM format requirements. All accepted workshop papers will be 
published in a formal proceedings by the IEEE Computer Society Press. One paper 
will be selected for the best paper award, which will be awarded at the workshop.
