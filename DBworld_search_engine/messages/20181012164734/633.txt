Introduction
     
Sustainable Computing and Communications refers to principles that embrace a range of policies, procedures, programs, and attitudes that run the length and breadth of any use of information and communication technologies. It is a holistic approach that stretches from power to waste to purchasing to education and is a life-cycle management approach to the deployment of IT across an organization. It includes designing, manufacturing, using, and disposing of information and communication systems with minimal or no impact on the environment.
   
SustainCom (Sustainable Computing and Communications) was created to provide a prime international forum for researchers, industry practitioners and domain experts to exchange the latest fundamental advances in the state of the art and practice of Sustainable Computing andCommunications as well as innovative applications.

Submission Guidelines
Submissions must include an abstract, keywords, the e-mail address of the corresponding author and should not exceed 8 pages for main conference, including tables and figures in IEEE CS format. The template files for LATEX or WORD can be downloaded here. All paper submissions must represent original and unpublished work. Each submission will be peer reviewed by at least three program committee members. Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will register for the conference and present the work. Submit your paper(s) in PDF file at the submission site: http://www.swinflow.org/confs/2018/sustaincom/submission.htm.
        
Publications
Accepted and presented papers will be included into the IEEE Conference Proceedings published by IEEE CS Press. Authors of accepted papers, or at least one of them, are requested to register and present their work at the conference, otherwise their papers may be removed from the digital libraries of IEEE CS and EI after the conference.
         
Distinguished papers will be selected for special issues in Information Sciences, Future Generation Computer Systems, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience.
