ABOUT the KNOWLEDGE REUSE research group
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Knowledge Reuse research group is a multidisciplinary research group, lead by Prof. Dr. Juan Llorens (http://www.linkedin.com/in/llorensjuan), with members belonging to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (http://www.inf.uc3m.es/en) and the Department of Library and Information Sciences.

KRâ€™s mission is to promote software and systems reuse within organizations, focusing on:

-Providing research in software and systems engineering processes and methods.
-Applying semantic-based technologies to Systems Engineering practice.
-Addressing the new-technology opportunities.
-Disseminating knowledge to the scientific and industrial communities.

KR brings together these activities to enable and support people, organizations and systems to collaborate and interoperate in the new global context. Our research lines focus on software and systems engineering applied to reuse, quality, traceability, interoperability and reasoning, with focus on:

-Software representation. Different means to understand, transform, retrieve and reuse software at any level.
-Systems Engineering. Exploiting knowledge-based techniques to effectively improve the communication among traditional systems
engineering practices and enable better solutions to the development of complex systems.
-Ontology engineering, mainly applied to systems engineering.

The following list summarizes some on-going projects in which the group is currently involved:

-AMASS (https://www.amass-ecsel.eu/). Architecture-driven, Multi-concern and Seamless Assurance and Certification of Cyber-Physical Systems.
-IoD (https://www.celticplus.eu/project-iod/). Internet of DevOps.
-IMOLA ( https://www.elra.eu/imola-ii/ ). Interoperability using Knowledge Management among Land Registry domain in Europe.
