Ambient intelligence refers to normal working and living environments being 
surrounded by embedded devices that can merge unobtrusively and in
natural ways using information and intelligence hidden in the network
connecting these devices (e.g. The Internet of Things). Such devices, each
specialised in one or more capabilities, are intended to work together based
on an infrastructure of intelligent systems, to provide a variety of services
improving safety, security and the quality of life in ordinary living, travelling
and working environments.

Accompanying the main conference, the following two workshops will be
organized:
