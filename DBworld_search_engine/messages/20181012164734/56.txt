 Introduction
--------------
Future technology information technology would stand for all of continuously evolving and converging information technologies, including digital convergence, multimedia convergence, intelligent applications, embedded systems, mobile and wireless communications, bio-inspired computing, grid and cloud computing, semantic web, user experience and HCI, security and trust computing and so on, for satisfying our ever-changing needs.

In past twenty five years or so, Information Technology (IT) influenced and changed every aspect of our lives and our cultures. Without various IT-based applications, we would find it difficult to keep information stored securely, to process information efficiently, and to communicate information conveniently. 

In the future world, IT will play a very important role in convergence of computing, communication, and all other computational sciences and application and IT also will influence the future world's various areas, including science, engineering, industry, business, law, politics, culture, medicine, and so on.
Our conference is intended to foster the dissemination of state-of-the-art research in all future IT areas, including their models, services, and novel applications associated with their utilization.

FutureTech2019 is the next edition of FutureTech2018(Salerno, Italy), FutureTech2017(Beijing, Vietnam), FutureTech2015(Hanoi, Vietnam), FutureTech2014(Zhangjiajie, China), FutureTech 2013(Gwangju, Korea), FutureTech2012(Vancouver, Canada), FutureTech2011(Loutraki, Greece), FutureTech2010 (Busan, Korea), which were the next events in a series of highly successful the International Symposium on Ubiquitous Applications & Security Services(UASS-09, USA), previously held as UASS-08(Okinawa, Japan), UASS-07 (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia), and UASS-06(Glasgow, Scotland, UK).

There will be a combination of presentations including scientific papers. Prospective authors are invited, in the first instance, to submit papers for oral presentations in any of the areas of interest for this conference. 
Authors should submit a paper based on page limitation including all figures, tables, and references. If you want to submit more than page limitation, you can add up to 2 extra pages with the appropriate fee payment. 
All accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings published by Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering (LNEE) - Springer (indexed by EI and SCOPUS).

Authors should submit a paper with 5~6 pages in length, including all figures, tables, and references. 
If you want to submit more than page limitation, you can add up to 2 extra pages (total MAX. 8 pages) with the extra page charges (100 USD per page).
Papers exceeding the page limits will be rejected without review.

Instructions for papers in the Springer's LNEE is as follows. (Note that the paper format of LNEE is the same as that of LNCS)
