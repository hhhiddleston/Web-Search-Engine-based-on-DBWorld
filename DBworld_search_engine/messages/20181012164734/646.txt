Introduction
     
The technologies of computing and communications have undergone a series of evolutionary innovation over the past decades and improved the quality of human life significantly. Computing and communications in the 21st century faces an ever-increasing number of great challenges and revolutionary developments. Ubiquitous Computing and Communications is a revolutionary paradigm that aims to provide pervasive and reliable computing solutions and communication services anytime and anywhere. This emerging technology is built upon the rapid research and development advances in a wide range of key areas including wireless and sensor networks, mobile and distributed computing, embedded systems, agent technologies, autonomic communication, and information security. Ubiquitous Computing and Communications has drawn significant interests from both academia and industry and continues to attract tremendous research efforts due to its promising new business opportunity in information technology and engineering.
   

The conference offers an important international platform and brings together the scientists, engineers, researchers, and students from academy and industry all over the world to share their latest work, exchange experiences and discuss the state-of-the-art challenges of ubiquitous computing and communications. IUCC 2018 is soliciting original and previously unpublished papers addressing research challenges and advances towards the design, implementation and evaluation of ubiquitous computing and communications technologies, systems and applications.
