BigTrust 2018 CFP: IEEE MASS' 2018 Workshop on Trust, Security and Privacy for Big Data
 
Venue & Dates: 
Chengdu, China, October 9-12, 2018
Conference Website:

Introduction
Big Data has the potential for enabling new insights to change science, engineering, medicine, healthcare, finance, 
business, and ultimately society itself. Current work on Big Data focuses on information processing such as data 
mining and analysis. However, trust, security and privacy of Big Data are vital concerns that have received less 
research focus. Regarding the above context, this workshop proposal is aimed at bringing together people from both 
academia and industry to present their most recent work related to trust, security and privacy issues in Big Data, 
and exchange ideas and thoughts in order to identify emerging research topics and define the future of Big Data.
BigTrust 2018 is a part of MASS 2018, the 15th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Systems.  
The scope and interests for the special issue include but are not limited to the following list:

Big Data Science, Foundations, and applications
           Novel Theoretical Models for Big Data.
           New Computational Models for Big Data.
           Data and Information Quality for Big Data.
           High Performance/Parallel Computing Platforms for Big Data .
           Energy-efficient Computing for Big Data.
           Big Data Search Architectures, Scalability and Efficiency.
           Visualization Analytics for Big Data.
           Data Acquisition, Integration, Cleaning, and Best Practices .
 
Trust in Big Data
           Trust semantics, metrics, and models for Big Data.
           Trust management and evaluation for Big Data.
           Trusted systems, software, and applications for Big Data.
           Trusted platform implementation technologies for Big Data.
           Information quality/trustworthiness for Big Data.
           Provenance of content for Big Data.
           Trustworthiness of ratings/recommender systems for Big Data.
 
Security & Privacy in Big Data
           Security model and architecture for Big Data.
