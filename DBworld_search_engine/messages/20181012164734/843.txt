The Internet of Things (IoT) describes a network of smart devices in the physical world, endowed with embedded sensors and networking capabilities. IoT is defined by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) as “a global infrastructure for the information society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual) things based on existing and evolving interoperable information and communication technologies.” The features of IoT that differ from traditional computing include the use of a multitude of devices with embedded sensors and connected to networks, introducing many benefits in terms of automation and optimization. IoT technologies are being widely adopted for a variety of applications including smart city, smart grid, smart home, industrial control systems, and now getting a lot of popularity on connected and smart cars, which are highly computerized automobiles featuring ubiquitous computing, intuitive human-computer interaction and an open application platform for IoT. For example, Google's and GM’s self-driving car. In general, a smart car can be characterized by the following properties: (a) Ubiquitous computing (ubicomp): assessing information or being assessed interactively and autonomously everywhere and anywhere via various sensors over different standard, such as the Controller Area Network (CAN), which is a multi-node bus protocol for short messages transmission of trigger signals and measurement values to support distributed control systems; (b) Human computer interaction (HCI): the essential interfaces of smart cars that offer an interaction between human and in-vehicle system in a context of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and IoT-to-Vehicle (I2V); and (c) Applications platform: allowing users to download the third-party application software in their in-vehicle system or even on an IoT for customizing the smart cars, for example, an in-vehicle Infotainment for information and entertainment applications. Topics to be discussed in this special issue include (but are not limited to) the following:
- IoT devices for in-vehicle systems
- IoT architectures for autonomous driving
- IoT data modeling and implementation
- Interoperable and interactive IoT middleware for in-vehicle systems 
- Analytics and algorithms for system improvement
- Communication infrastructures of IoT for in-vehicle systems
- Security, privacy, and trust of IoT for in-vehicle systems
- Industry standards and solution stacks
- Provenance tracking frameworks and tools
- Innovative applications and Case Studies
