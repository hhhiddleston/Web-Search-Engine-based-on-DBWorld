The  SoCC  poster  sessions  showcase  works-in-progress  in  an  informal  setting.  
Topics  of  interest  are  the  same  as  the research  topics  in  the  SoCC  conference  
call  for  papers (https://acmsocc.github.io/2018/papers.html). Accepted proposals  will  
be  published  in  the  conference  proceedings. While  anyone  can  submit  a  proposal,  
preference  will  be given  to  posters  where  the  primary  contribution  is  from  one 
 or  more  students  or  from  an  industry/start-up  organization. Students  must  present  
 student  posters  at  the  conference.  An  award  will  be  given  to  the  best  overall  
 student  and industry/start-up  poster,  judged during  the  conference.  Submissions  to  the  
 conference  paper  track  are also  automatically  considered  for  a  poster,  so  there  is  
 no  need  to  submit  a  separate  poster  proposal.
