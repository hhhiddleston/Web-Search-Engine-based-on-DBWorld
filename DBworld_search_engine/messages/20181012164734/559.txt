======================= ABOUT AWC2019 =======================

The relentless growth in Internet functionality and broadband access has enabled a new wave of innovations that are transforming the way people and organisations interact, communicate, and collaborate. The 5th Australasian Web Conference (AWC) focuses on presenting original contributions on research, development, and applications, related to all fields of Web research.

AWC is part of the Australasian Computer Science Week (ACSW). Registration to the Australasian Computer Science Conference enables delegates to attend sessions in any conference participating in ACSW. The proceedings will be included in the ACM Digital Library and indexed on Scopus and DBLP.
