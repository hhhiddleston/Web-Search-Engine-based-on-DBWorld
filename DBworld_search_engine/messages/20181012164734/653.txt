Dear Colleagues:

We cordially invite you to share your latest research results at the 2018 Internet of Vehicles (IOV) conference.

*** Best Paper Award(s), Best Student Paper Award(s) and Best Poster(s) will be granted at IOV 2018.

CALL FOR PAPERS
---------------------------
Internet of Vehicles (IOV) as an important part of the wisdom city is a complex integrated network system, which connects different people within automotives, different automotives and different environment entries in cities. IOV is different from Telematics, Vehicle Ad hoc Networks, and Intelligent Transportation, in which vehicles like phones can run within the whole network, and obtain various services by swarm intelligent computing with people, vehicles, and environments.

IOV 2018 is to establish an international forum for engineers and scientists to present their excellent ideas, latest innovations and experiences on Internet of Vehicles. We welcomes paper submissions on innovative work from researchers in academia, industry and government describing original research work, sharing the experience and insights, forecast the trends and opportunities, and discuss the policy, economics and social implications.

IOV 2018 will be held on November 6 - 9, 2018, in Paris, France. 
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Vehicle Behavior Model and Environment Awareness
- Cooperative Driving, Intelligent and Autonomous Vehicles
- Telematics, Wireless Communication Networks for IOV
- Services and applications of IOV
- Complex systems and systems-of-systems for IOV
- Theory, technology, methodology, tools and applications for IOV
- Wireless Communications and Vehicular Networking
- Vision-based driver assistance

Proposals for organizing tutorials, workshops and Special sessions
need to be submitted to the Tutorials, Workshops and Special Sessions
Chair. A proposal should include title, theme, scope and main
presenters/organizers.

Research paper (14 pages) should explore a specific technology problem
and propose a complete solution to it, with experimental
results. Works-in-Progress (WIP) (12 pages) papers are expected to
present either work currently in progress or less developed but highly
innovative ideas. Demo/Poster papers (10 pages) must describe working
systems and be related to IOV. These systems may be innovative
prototype implementations or mature systems that use related
technology. Papers/proposals need to be submitted to the Demo/Poster
track.
