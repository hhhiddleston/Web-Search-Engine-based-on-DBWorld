Scope

Internet has revolutionized the globalized society and enabled the growth of infrastructures, applications, and technologies that significantly enhance global interactions and collaborations that have significant impact on society. Unprecedented cyber-social, and cyber-physical infrastructures and systems that span geographic boundaries are possible because of the Internet and the growing number of collaboration enabling technologies. Individuals and organizations have increasingly relied on electronic and/or Internet-enabled collaboration between distributed teams of humans, computer applications, and/or autonomous robots to achieve higher productivity and produce collaboratively developed products that would have been impossible to develop without the contributions of multiple collaborators.

Technology has evolved from standalone tools, to open systems supporting collaboration in multi-organizational settings, and from general purpose tools to specialized collaboration platforms. Future collaboration and Internet computing solutions that further the goal of achieving the full potential of global level collaboration require advancements in networking, technology and systems, user interfaces and interaction, cooperation and collaboration paradigms, and interoperation with application-specific components and tools.

IEEE CIC has been conceived as the key multidisciplinary venue to serve as a premier international forum for discussion among academic and industrial researchers, practitioners, and students interested in Internet technologies, applications and services, collaborative networking, technology and systems, and applications.

***********************
Blue Sky/Vision Track *
*********************** 

We would like to solicit papers that promote visionary ideas and blue sky thinking in areas aligned with the conference themes. These papers are expected to spark intense discussions and newer research directions/insights through potentially disruptive, controversial, or highly cross-disciplinary ideas that look forward to collaboration and internet computing space for the next 10 years and beyond. Ideas that are just being conceived, not fully developed, far from experimentally evaluated, or out-of-the box are highly encouraged. The papers should follow the same format as the regular conference papers and are limited to 6 pages.

***********************
Industry Track Papers *
***********************

We would like to solicit papers that focus on design, implementation and deployment of solutions related to Collaboration and Internet Computing within the industrial or government environments. The papers submitted to this track are expected to advance practical and applied research focused on the use of CIC technologies, and real world CIC relevant networks, systems applications. Applications, such as: Internet enabled collaborative e-commerce, medical and pharmaceutical, defense, critical cyber-physical infrastructures, public policy, finance, engineering, environment, manufacturing, telecommunications, and government.
The Industry/Government Track will include papers selected through a separate program committee. Authors must clearly indicate sub-areas their papers are to be evaluated in because distinct criteria may be used for reviewing different category of submissions:

-----------
* Deployed:
-----------

Deployed systems that aim to provide real practical value to industry, Government, or other organizations, or communities. The papers should point out how the deployed system explicitly leverage CIC technologies or describe either qualitatively (lessons learnt, deployment experiences, etc.) or quantitatively the effect of use of CIC relevant technology in operational environments.

-----------
* Emerging:
-----------

Newer applications that use collaboration and internet computing as central themes are expected here. The authors should clearly demonstrate value and interest to Industry, Government of society (e.g., scientific or medical professions; critical infrastructures). Papers that describe infrastructure development and deployment that enables the large-scale deployment of CIC technologies or their validation are also in these areas.

Workshops Proposals
Proposals for half-day or full day workshops that focus on IEEE CIC 2018 related themes are solicited. Workshop proposals should be at most five pages, including a biographical sketch of each instructor, and submitted to the Workshop Chairs. Proposals will be evaluated based on the expertise and experience of the organizers and the relevance and importance of the subject matter. Please refer to call for workshop proposals for details.
Panels Proposals
Proposals for panel discussions that focus on future visions relevant to Collaboration and Internet Computing are preferred. Potential panel organizers should submit a panel proposal of at most five pages, including biographical sketches of the proposed panelists to the Panel Chairs.

Tutorials Proposals
Proposals for full and half-day tutorials are solicited. Tutorials are intended to enhance the technical program, and as such they should be relevant to collaborative computing, networking, internet technologies, worksharing, and applications. Potential tutorial presenters should submit a tutorial proposal of at most three pages, including: description of potential audience and background knowledge expected from the audience, if any; tutorial description; biographical sketch(s) of presenter(s).

-------
Awards:
-------

IEEE CIC will feature a Best Paper award and a Best Student Paper award (to be selected by the program committee/best paper award team). A paper is eligible for the Best Student Paper award if the first author is a full-time student at the time of submission. A partial travel grant or cash award may be offered to the winner student depending on fund availability.
Paper Submission.

------------
Submissions:
------------

We invite original research papers that have not been previously published and are not currently under review for publication elsewhere. Contributions addressing all areas related to collaborative networking, technology and systems, and applications are solicited. Papers submitted to Regular or Industry/Gov track should be no longer than 10 pages in the standard two column IEEE proceedings format, which can be found at https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html. The papers can be submitted at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ieeecic2018

Review Policy:

IEEE Policy and professional ethics require that referees treat the contents of papers under review as privileged information not to be disclosed to others before publication. It is expected that no one with access to a paper under review will make any inappropriate use of the special knowledge, which that access provides. Contents of abstracts submitted to conference program committees should be regarded as privileged as well, and handled in the same manner. The Conference Publications Chair shall ensure that referees adhere to this practice.
Organizers of IEEE conferences are expected to provide an appropriate forum for the oral presentation and discussion of all accepted papers. An author, in offering a paper for presentation at an IEEE conference, or accepting an invitation to present a paper, is expected to be present at the meeting to deliver the paper. In the event that circumstances unknown at the time of submission of a paper preclude its presentation by an author, the program chair should be informed on time, and appropriate substitute arrangements should be made. In some cases it may help reduce no-shows for the Conference to require advance registration together with the submission of the final manuscript.
