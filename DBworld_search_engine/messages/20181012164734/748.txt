We welcome poster abstracts describing works in progress, or
innovative ideas not mature enough to be presented as a full
paper. The poster track will provide an opportunity to present
early-stage work and receive feedback from the community,
especially on thought-provoking or controversial work,
approaches, or ideas from students.

Posters are submitted for review in the form of an extended
abstract that has to be formatted in LNCS-style and not exceed 1
page in length, with a PDF draft of the proposed poster included
as page 2 of the submission (A0 size in portrait mode, W 841mm x
H 1189 mm, with all fonts embedded in the PDF file). In addition,
poster titles should always start with the phrase 'Poster
Abstract:'. Accepted posters will be presented at the symposium
in a separate session. Authors of accepted full papers are also
encouraged to submit and present posters of their paper in the
poster session. If the poster submission is for an accepted
paper, add the following keywords to your submission: 'Poster for
Accepted Paper: '.

Note that the poster abstracts have a separate deadline from the
full papers and will not be included in the proceedings.

Please contact cbt2018@easychair.org in case of doubts and questions.
