CALL FOR PAPERS

The workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in topics related to Data Science. Submitted papers should be related with one or more of two areas. The first one, data Engineering, which is defined as the process of designing, building, managing, and evaluating advanced data systems and applications. The second one, data analytics, which is defined as the process of deriving higher-level information from (usually large) sets of raw data.

Examples of articles could include discussing new methods or algorithms, or applications including Machine Learning, Databases, optimization or any type of algorithms which consider managing or obtaining value from data.
