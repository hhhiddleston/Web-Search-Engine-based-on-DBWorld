Position Title :
Subject Matter Expert 
Faculty/Academic Area :
Faculty of Science
Department :
Physics and Computer Science
Campus :
Waterloo
Position Summary :
The Faculty of Science at Wilfrid Laurier University invites applications to develop an online course beginning on or before October 1, 2018 and concluding by no later than March 31, 2019. An opportunity to teach the course once it is developed will be available. The online course CP640-Machine Learning is intended for the Master of Computer Science program. This course introduces students to machine learning, data mining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks) and unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). Students learn a variety of learning algorithms and determine which are most likely to be successful.
The Subject Matter Expert (SME) will work collaboratively with Faculty advisors and the Online Learning Department to develop the online course curriculum. The course will be developed and delivered online, therefore the SME will serve as part of an online course design team comprising instructional designers, educational technologists, accessibility experts, librarians and other support staff as required. Learning outcomes, the grading scheme and other aspects related to learning activities within the course have already been determined. The SME will prepare a course syllabus, academic student support materials, activities for the web, multimedia materials, and learning and study strategies. The SME will be required to submit all work to the academic advisors for review and final approval.   
Applicants should have an MSc, or preferred PhD, in the field of computer science or data science, and extensive experience in the subject matter. Success in teaching online courses, preferably at the graduate level, experience in developing and/or teaching in an online environment, and a receptivity to pedagogical approaches that specifically embrace online learners are preferred. Knowledge of learning management systems (particularly Brightspace from Desire2Learn) would be an asset. 

Applicants should send a curriculum vitae and contact information for at least three referees to Dr. Chinh T. Hoang, chair, department of Physics and Computer Science, Wilfrid Laurier University (email: choang@wlu.ca). Electronic submission of applications is preferred. Applications will be accepted until September 15, 2018.
