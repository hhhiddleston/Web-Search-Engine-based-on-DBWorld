The mission of the Joint International Semantic Technology Conference (JIST) is to bring together researchers in the Semantic Technology research community and other areas of semantic-related technologies to present their innovative research results or novel applications of semantic technologies.

There are two tracks in JIST 2018.

Research Track
JIST 2018 research track solicits submissions of original research work on semantic technologies. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Ontology and reasoning
Knowledge graph
Linked Data
Big Data and semantics, exchange and integration
Data streams and the Internet of Things
Machine learning and information extraction on the Semantic Web
Semantic Web services and processes
Trust, privacy, and security on the Semantic Web
Social Semantic Web
Natural language processing and semantics
Semantic multimedia
Novel applications of semantic technologies
Special Session Track
JIST 2018 special session track to discover and implement special topics that researchers in Semantic Technology are particularly interested in. We also intend to facilitate participation of potentially-related researchers in the JIST conference. Topics of special sessions are as follows:

Special Session on Government Open Data
Special Session on Question Answering and ChatBots
Special Session on Resource-aware Semantic Technologies
Special Session on Semantic Web for Life Sciences
