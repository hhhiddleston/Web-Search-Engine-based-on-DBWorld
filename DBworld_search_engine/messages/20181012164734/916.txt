======================================
The Second IEEE Workshop on
Human-in-the-loop Methods and Human-Machine Collaboration
in Big Data (IEEE HMData 2018) co-located with IEEE Bigdata 2018
Seattle, Dec. 10th (Tentative)
https://humanmachinedata.org
======================================

Overview
Human power is a key factor to maximize the impact of bigdata 
technologies. This workshop addresses human-in-the-loop 
approaches in bigdata lifecycle - in collecting, processing, analyzing, 
utilizing, archiving and disposing them. The purpose of this workshop 
is to give excellent opportunities for students, researchers and 
practitioners to identify important research problems and exchange 
their ideas on human-in-the-loop in the bigdata context. To make 
the workshop an attractive place for those people, we solicit 
practitioner papers as well as research papers, in order to facilitate 
discussion among researchers who know solutions and practitioners 
who know problems. We also would like to make the place valuable 
for young researchers. All papers accepted for the workshop will be 
included in the Workshop Proceedings published by the IEEE 
Computer Society Press, made available at the Conference.

Topics
This workshop covers a wide range of human-related topics in the 
bigdata context, such as crowdsourcing, collaborative recommendation, 
crowdsensing, workflow model for humans and machines, incentives, 
human-assisted bigdata analysis, bigdata-human interaction, 
supporting tools for humans in human-in-the-loop systems, security 
and privacy in human-machine collaboration , human factors and 
ELSI (ethical, legal and social issues) in human-in-the-loop systems, 
and human-machine collaboration in real-world problems.

Keynote

Professor Dan Weld (University of Washington)

Bio: Daniel S. Weld is Thomas J. Cable / WRF Professor in the Paul 
G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering and Entrepreneurial 
Faculty Fellow at the University of Washington. After formative education 
at Phillips Academy, he received bachelor's degrees in both Computer 
Science and Biochemistry at Yale University in 1982. He landed a Ph.D. 
from the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1988, received a Presidential 
Young Investigator's award in 1989, an Office of Naval Research Young 
Investigator's award in 1990, was named AAAI Fellow in 1999 and 
deemed ACM Fellow in 2005. Dan was a founding editor for the Journal 
of AI Research, was area editor for the Journal of the ACM, guest editor 
for Computational Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence, and was 
Program Chair for AAAI-96. Dan has published two books and scads of 
technical papers. Dan is an active entrepreneur with several patents 
and technology licenses. He co-founded Netbot Incorporated, creator of 
Jango Shopping Search (acquired by Excite), AdRelevance, a monitoring 
service for internet advertising (acquired by Nielsen NetRatings), and 
data integration company Nimble Technology (acquired by Actuate). 
Dan is a Venture Partner at the Madrona Venture Group and on the 
Scientific Advisory Boards of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence 
and the Madrona Venture Group. Dan teaches many courses, including 
graduate classes on Artificial Intelligence, Extracting, Managing & 
Personalizing Web Information and Intelligent User Interfaces, and 
undergraduate classes on Artficial Intelligence, Advanced Internet 
Systems, and Machine Learning. In 2012, Dan co-organized a workshop 
on Crowdsourcing Personalized Online Education. During sabbaticals 
Dan was a visiting professor at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia 
and visited the VIBE group at Microsoft Research.

Submission
All submissions must be submitted electorically through CyberChair
(to be open soon). Please prefix your submission category such as 
[Research Paper] to the Title of Paper field in the submission page. 
For example, if you would like to submit a project-in-progress paper 
"Crowd-centric Approach to Digital Archive Maintenance," you have 
to put "[project-in-progress paper] Crowd-centric Approach to Digital 
Archive Maintenance" into the Title of Paper field.

All papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the Workshop 
Proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, made 
available at the Conference.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Submission Categories

Research Papers (*) (long presentation): They report significant and 
original results relevant to the scope of this workshop. We solicit 
innovative or thought-provoking work but they do not necessarily 
have to reach the level of completion. The expected length is between 
4 and 6 pages. The maximum length is 10 pages, though the paper 
should be commensurate with the size of the contribution.

Practitioner papers (*)(long presentation): They present interesting 
problems that require human-in-the-loop solutions in a variety of 
application domains, or present the interesting results of applying 
existing human-in-the-loop solutions to their domains. The expected 
length is between 4 and 6 pages. The maximum length is 10 pages, 
though the paper should be commensurate with the size of the contribution.

Project-in-progress papers (short presentation): They present the goals, 
challenges, and preliminary results of research or real-world projects 
in progress. The maximum length is 3 pages.

(*) Some of the papers submitted to the research or practitioner paper 
categories may be accepted as project-in-progress papers and allotted 
to short presentation slots.

Format:
Papers should be formatted to IEEE Computer Society Proceedings 
Manuscript Formatting Guidelines in the IEEE Bigdata 2018 CFP page
