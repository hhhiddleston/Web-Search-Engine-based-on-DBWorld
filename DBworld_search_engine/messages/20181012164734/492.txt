Dear Colleagues,

The MDPI Sensors solicits paper submissions and aim to bring together researchers and application developers working on the intersection of IoT with next-generation sensor development, distributed, cloud, internet, mobile, ambient, semantic, real-time, secure and privacy-preserving computing. We also aim to explore the application of novel IoT computing results and describe and assess their impact.

Topics of Interest

Research topics of interest track include (but not necessary limited to these):

•Development of smart IoT devices and robots that provide information from and perform actions in the IoT cyber-physical ecosystem
•Discovery and integration of IoT devices and their data permitting the use of billions of IoT devices that have been deployed, owned, and controlled by others – one of the major benefits of IoT
•Real-time IoT data analysis on the cloud, at the edge, and on the move, including localisation, personalisation, and contextualisation of IoT data
•IoT Security and privacy for IoT devices with limited computing resource and connectivity
•IoT Actuation via IoT devices, robots and process-based automation
•Lower-power and longer-range IoT networking for IoT devices
•Wearable IoT devices and systems
•Human performance monitoring, human/IoT integration, and IoT information visualisation

Application topics of interest include all aspects of, but not limited to:

•Smart city services, including transportation, utilities, pollution management, and disaster management
•Smart grids, including hybrid power stations and demand side management
•Smart farming, including crop irrigation, fertilisation, and crop assessment and recommendation
•Smart manufacturing including Industry 4.0 and the Industrial Internet
•Smart retail chains, including supply chain management and probability marketing

The deadline for manuscript submissions is 28 February 2019. 

This special issue will be published on MDPI Sensors (ISSN 1424-8220), section "Internet of Things". More information about this special issue, including the manuscript submission information, can be found at:
