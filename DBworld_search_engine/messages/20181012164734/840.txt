SCOPE AND TOPICS

Research in multimedia computing is generally concerned with presentation, integration and computation of one or more media, such as text, image, graphics, audio, video, social data, and data collected from various sensors, etc., using computing techniques. The 20th IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM2018) is the flagship conference of IEEE Technical Committee on Multimedia (TCMC) and an international forum for researchers to exchange information regarding advances in the state of the art and practice of multimedia computing, as well as to identify the emerging research topics and define the future of multimedia computing.

The technical program of ISM2018 will consist of invited talks, paper presentations, and panel discussions. Submissions are solicited for full papers and workshop papers. Topics for submission include but are not limited to:

SUBMISSIONS

ISM2018 welcomes high-quality submissions on a variety of theoretical and application research works related to multimedia technologies. Submitted papers must not have been published previously. There are three different submission categories: REGULAR, SHORT, and POSTER whose lengths are expected to be 8, 4, and 2 pages long, respectively. The decision of paper category will be made by the program committee. Please note that the main difference between the paper categories is the size but not the importance of the contributions. In other words, a paper with 8 pages will be expected to have more contribution than one with 4 pages.

All manuscripts should be written in English. The templates in A4 size for manuscripts as well as camera-ready papers are available at IEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings (https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). All paper submissions will be carefully reviewed by at least three experts and reviews will be returned to the author(s) with comments to ensure the high quality of the accepted papers. The authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the conference. Please only submit original material where copyright of all parts is owned by the authors declared and which is not currently under review elsewhere. Please see the IEEE policies (https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/index.html) for further information.

Only electronic submission will be accepted. Technical paper authors MUST submit their manuscripts in PDF through the EasyChair submission system (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ism2018).
