About ICCS:
==========

The International Conferences on Conceptual Structures (ICCS) focus on the formal analysis and representation of conceptual knowledge, at the crossroads of artificial intelligence, human cognition, computational linguistics, and related areas of computer science and cognitive science. The ICCS conferences evolved from a series of seven annual workshops on conceptual graphs, starting with an informal gathering hosted by John F. Sowa in 1986. Recently, graph-based knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) paradigms are getting more and more attention.  With the rise of quasi-autonomous AI, graph-based representations provide a vehicle for making machine cognition explicit to its human users.  The aim of the ICCS 2019 conference is to build upon its long standing expertise in graph-based KRR and focus on providing modelling, formal and application results of graph-based systems.
The conference welcomes contributions that address graph-based representation and reasoning paradigms (e.g. Bayesian Networks (BNs), Semantic Networks (SNs), RDF(S), Conceptual Graphs (CGs), Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), CP-Nets, GAI-Nets, Graph Databases, Diagrams, etc.) from a modelling, theoretical and application viewpoint:

â€¢ Modelling results will investigate concrete real world needs for graph-based representation, how certain use cases are of interest to the graph community, how using graphs can bring added (business) value, what kind of graph representation is needed for a given case, etc.
â€¢ Technical results will include fundamental graph theory based results for novel structures for representation, extensions of existing structures for added expressivity, conciseness, optimisation algorithms for reasoning, reasoning explanation, etc.
â€¢ Papers reporting on application experience will be expected to demonstrate the benefits of the graph-based proposed solutions in the context of the use case studied. Where appropriate, the graph-based solutions are compared to other possible solutions.
