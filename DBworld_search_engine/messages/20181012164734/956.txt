        TEACHING FOCUSED LECTURER



------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Job Reference : S&E-012246

   Closing Date : 23/07/2018

         Salary : Â£31,604 to Â£38.833 per annum, depending on experience

Employment Type : Full time, permanent, available a.s.a.p.

------------------------------------------------------------------------



We are looking for a motivated and enthusiastic Teaching Focused

Lecturer to undertake and support undergraduate and postgraduate

teaching. The focus of the post will be on data management, but will

also involve teaching other core aspects of the Computer Science

curriculum. 



The role will entail developing curricula, designing and delivering

teaching sessions in formats such as workshops, clinics, tutorials and

traditional lectures, designing and supervising lab sessions,

designing assessments, and other general teaching and teaching-related

administration tasks. 



Although the role will involve general computer science teaching, it

is specifically intended to support our teaching in data management,

both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Data management is

present at all levels in the curriculum; first-year undergraduate

students develop database-driven web applications, second-year

students are introduced to the relational model, and final year

undergraduates investigate big data and data on the web. At Masters

level, students obtain experience with semi-structured data and

database systems internally, as well as methodologies for data

engineering and data mining. Our goal is to provide a solid foundation

in principles, informed by and demonstrated in practical applications. 



You will have excellent communication and organisational skills and

the ability to work effectively with undergraduate and postgraduate

students, and academic staff colleagues. You will be a self-motivated

person that can use their initiative to work flexibly, on their own or

as part of a team. 



You will have a strong background in computer science as a whole, and

in particular experience through research and/or industrial experience

in data management. This can include the areas identified above, but

we constantly review our curriculum and would be interested in

experience from applicants in any area of data management. You will be

enthusiastic about the need for teaching real-world data management

skills to students within the constraints of a lab environment.

appointment will always be made on merit.
