Special Issue on Emerging ICT Applications and Service - Big Data, IoT, and Cloud Computing

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has become very prominent in the area of communication system (CS) all across the world. In the ICT based modern societies, Big data, Internet of Things (IoT), and Cloud computing: BIC are key components that are likely to play a significant role in the next generation. In addition, the BIC has been rapidly coming in our life as a new emerging ICT paradigm. There are diverse kinds of technical skills and approaches in the BICbased ICT infrastructures and services. The currently available ICT techniques for CS are still in the challenging phase, such as collecting and processing large amounts of data from diverse CS devices. The design and development of ICT for CS make innovation at the rapid phase. It can deliver efficient BIC-based solutions to handle the large amount of CS data with limited computational capacity. In particular, we expect articles that examine the challenges that arise in developing novel BIC applications and services in communication systems. This special issue focuses on the design and development of innovative ICT principles and methods for BIC emergence. In this special issue, we are soliciting original contributions on theories, methodologies, models, technologies, applications, services that based on the emerging ICT of big data, IoT and cloud computing.

Topics of Interests: Topics of interests include, but are not limited to: 

-BIC based a emerging ICT model 
-BIC based the next generation communication architecture 
-BIC emergence based 5G networks and communications
