The 2nd International Workshop on Social Computing (IWSC2018) is a main international forum for scientists, engineers, and users to exchange and share their experiences, new ideas, and latest research results on all aspects of social computing. IWSC2018 will be held in Singapore, November 17th, 2018. It will be held in parallel with the 18th International Conference on Data Mining (http://icdm2018.org/) in Singapore, November 17-20, 2018. 

In this workshop, we aim to attract researchers from all over the world working in the field of social computing, with a particular focus on social usersâ€™ behaviours, activities, interactions, news propagations, and social influence learning models in the context of available spatial or location information in urban cities. IWSC2018 also welcomes all researchers in the database, data mining, natural language processing, social data and web mining to utilize their expertise and match up to develop more efficient and practical algorithms or models to obtain smart knowledge from daily generated invaluable social media and web data. Research topics include, but are not limited to:
