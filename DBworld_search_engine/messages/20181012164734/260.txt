Special Issue for Applied Network Science

Expression of interest: September 21, 2018
Full paper submission: October 28, 2018.

The growing availability of multirelational data gives rise to an opportunity for novel characterization of complex real-world relations. The design of innovative complex approaches is the key to enable a deeper understanding of feature-rich networks, i.e., network models exposing specific features able to enhance their expressive power. Some examples of feature-rich networks are Multilayer Networks, Temporal and Heterogeneous Networks, Knowledge Graphs, Probabilistic Networks and generic Attributed Graphs. In this scenario, the need to expose and process domain-specific features when facing critical real-world tasks can prompt researchers to exploit the full potential of mining complex network structures. The aim of this Special Issue is to provide an insight into innovative methods to model, analyze and mine feature-rich networks inspired from different fields, incentivizing domain-driven approaches that can drive the design of novel network models. 

You are invited to submit a contribution (regular manuscripts or review article). Topics of interest for this special issue include (but are not limited to):

â€¢ Centrality and Ranking in Feature-rich Networks
â€¢ Community Detection in Feature-rich Networks
â€¢ Cross domain problems in Feature-rich Networks
â€¢ Link Prediction in Feature-rich Networks
â€¢ Probabilistic and Uncertain Feature-rich Networks
â€¢ Pattern mining in Feature-rich Networks
â€¢ Personalization and Recommendation in Feature-rich Networks
â€¢ Representation Learning in Feature-rich Networks
â€¢ Reputation and Trust in Feature-rich Networks
â€¢ Sampling/Pruning/Simplification of Feature-rich Networks
â€¢ Social Influence and Information Diffusion in Feature-rich Networks
â€¢ Time-evolving Feature-rich Networks
