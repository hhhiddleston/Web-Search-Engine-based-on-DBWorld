*************************************************************************

AIMS:

LATA is a conference series on theoretical computer science and its applications. LATA 2019 will reserve significant room for young scholars at the beginning of their career. It will aim at attracting contributions from classical theory fields as well as application areas.

VENUE:

LATA 2019 will take place in Saint Petersburg, whose historic centre is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The conference site shall be the historical Twelve Collegia building (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Collegia), built in ca. 1740, 
which was used for the Russian government in the 18th century, and which 
has been the main building of Saint Petersburg State University since 1835.

SCOPE:

Topics of either theoretical or applied interest include, but are not limited to:

algebraic language theory
algorithms for semi-structured data mining
algorithms on automata and words
automata and logic
automata for system analysis and programme verification
automata networks
automatic structures
codes
combinatorics on words
computational complexity
concurrency and Petri nets
data and image compression
descriptional complexity
foundations of finite state technology
foundations of XML
grammars (Chomsky hierarchy, contextual, unification, categorial, etc.)
grammatical inference and algorithmic learning
graphs and graph transformation
language varieties and semigroups
language-based cryptography
mathematical and logical foundations of programming methodologies
parallel and regulated rewriting
parsing
patterns
power series
string processing algorithms
symbolic dynamics
term rewriting
transducers
trees, tree languages and tree automata
weighted automata

STRUCTURE:

LATA 2019 will consist of:

invited talks
peer-reviewed contributions
