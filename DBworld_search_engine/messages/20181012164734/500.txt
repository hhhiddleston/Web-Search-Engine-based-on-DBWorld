            CALL FOR PAPERS 

  34th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing 

        Track on Digital Life for Human Well-being

             April 8 â€“ 12, 2019 Limassol, Cyprus

Aims and rationale 
================== 

Digital services are an integral part of many aspects of our everyday life, 
from the workplace to leisure time, to our daily life in our own living 
environment. It is our desire to have a comfortable and safe life, 
characterized by social relationships that reinforce our need for 
belonging and esteem (for example, self-esteem and achievement). 
Furthermore, our needs include health and quality of life and every 
other aspect that involves social, economic, cognitive and psychological 
spheres. Digital Life for Human Well-being is a part of the heart of the 
 â€œsmart societyâ€ and implies the need to respect the needs identified by 
Maslowâ€™s pyramid: physiological (for example, food and energy), safety, 
belonging (for example, friendship and social inclusion), esteem 
 (for example, recognition) and self-fulfillment (for example, creativity).
This track is dedicated to methodologies and technologies that can be 
helpful, guarantee and improve quality of life, and support positive well-being. 
 It also includes the field of assistive technologies, i.e., systems, products or 
software programs that increase, maintain, or improve the functional 
capabilities of people with disabilities, including elderly people, in their 
daily lives, education, work or leisure.
We seek original, unpublished contributions that are mainly focused on, but not 
necessarily limited to: 

- Ageing, disability and technology
- Ambient assisted living
- Assistive devices and services
- Care technologies
- E-accessibility
- E-inclusion
- Independent living
- Methodological approaches and tools for the assessment of wellbeing
- Mobile applications for well-being
- Mobility for fragile people
- Smart homes/environments
- Tools to promote social/emotional/physical well-being
- Wearable devices to improve quality of life
- Well-being of aging people
- Well-being in education, employment and leisure activities

Proceedings and Post-Proceedings 
================================ 
Papers accepted for the Digital Life for Human Well-Being track 
will be published by ACM both in the SAC 2019 proceedings and 
in the ACM Digital Library.
Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of the 
paper/poster in the conference proceedings.  An author or a proxy 
attending SAC MUST present the paper: this is a requirement for the 
paper/poster to be included in the ACM/IEEE digital library. 
No-show of scheduled papers and posters will result in excluding 
them from the ACM/IEEE digital library.
The authors of the best papers presented at the track will be invited 
to submit an extended version of their work to be published in the 
journal Technology and Disability, IOS press.


Student Research Competition (SRC) Program 
========================================== 
Graduate students are invited to submit research abstracts 
(maximum of 3 pages in ACM camera-ready format,  with an optional 
extra page at the expense of 80 USD pages) following the 
instructions published at SAC 2019 website. Submission of the 
same abstract to multiple tracks is not allowed. 

All research abstract submissions will be reviewed by researchers and 
practitioners with expertise in the track focus area to which they are 
submitted. Authors of selected abstracts (up to 20 students) will have 
the opportunity to give poster and oral presentations of their work 
and compete for three top-winning places. The SRC committee will 
evaluate and select First, Second, and Third place winners. 
The winners will receive medals, cash awards, and SIGAPP recognition 
certificates during the conference banquet. Invited students receive 
SRC travel support (US$500) and are eligible to apply to the SIGAPP 
Student Travel Award Program (STAP) for additional travel support. 

Paper Submission 
================ 
Original papers from the above-mentioned or other related areas will be 
considered. This includes three categories of submissions: 

- Research work (limited to 8 pages in camera-ready format, included 
in the registration fee. Authors have the option to include up to two (2) 
extrapages at additional fee of US$80 per page.).
- Reports of innovative computing applications in the arts, sciences, 
engineering, government, education, and industry; Reports of successful 
technology transfer to new problem domains; Reports of industrial 
experience and demos of new innovative systems (limited to 8 pages in 
camera-ready format, included in the registration fee. Authors have the
 option to include up to two (2) extrapages at additional fee of US$80 per 
page).
- Poster submission with short papers (limited to 3 pages in camera-ready
 format, included in the registration fee. Authors have the option to 
include only one (1) extra page at additional fee of US$80).

Each submitted paper will undergo a blind review process and will be 
refereed by at least three referees. 
To ease blind review, *you shall remove author names* from your 
paper before submitting it. 
Accepted papers in all categories will be published in the ACM SAC 
2019 proceedings. 

The camera-ready version of the accepted paper should be prepared using 
the ACM format (guidelines are given on the SAC 2019 web site).
