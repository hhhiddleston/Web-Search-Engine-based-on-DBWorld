                                 Workshop Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The objective of this one-day workshop is to investigate opportunities
in accelerating analytics and data management workloads (which include
traditional OLTP, data warehousing/OLAP, ETL, Streaming/Real-time,
Business Analytics, and XML/RDF Processing) using processors (e.g.,
commodity and specialized Multi-core, GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs), storage
systems (e.g., Storage-class Memories like SSDs and Phase-change
Memory), programming models like MapReduce, Spark, CUDA, OpenCL,
and OpenACC, and operating environments such as cloud.

The current data management scenario is characterized by the following
trends: traditional OLTP and OLAP/data warehousing systems are being
used for increasing complex workloads (e.g., Petabyte of data, complex
queries under real-time constraints, etc.); applications are becoming
far more distributed, often consisting of different data processing
components; non-traditional domains such as bio-informatics, social
networking, mobile computing, sensor applications, gaming are
generating growing quantities of data of different types; economical
and energy constraints are leading to greater consolidation and
virtualization of resources; and analyzing vast quantities of complex
data is becoming more important than traditional transactional
processing. 

At the same time, there have been tremendous improvements in the CPU
and memory technologies. Newer processors are more capable in the CPU
and memory capabilities and are optimized for multiple application
domains. Commodity systems are increasingly using multi-core
processors with more than 6 cores per chip and enterprise-class
systems are using processors with 8 cores per chip, where each core
can execute upto 4 simultaneous threads. Specialized multi-core
processors such as the GPUs have brought the computational
capabilities of supercomputers to cheaper commodity machines. On the
storage front, FLASH-based solid state devices (SSDs) are becoming
smaller in size, cheaper in price, and larger in capacity. Exotic
technologies like Phase-change memory are on the near-term horizon and
can be game-changers in the way data is stored and processed. 

In spite of the trends, currently there is limited usage of these
technologies in data management domain. Naive usage of multi-core
processors or SSDs often leads to unbalanced system. It is therefore
important to evaluate applications in a holistic manner to ensure
effective utilization of CPU and memory resources. This workshop aims
to understand impact of modern hardware technologies on accelerating
core components of data management workloads. Specifically, the
workshop hopes to explore the interplay between overall system design,
core algorithms, query optimization strategies, programming
approaches, performance modelling and evaluation, etc., from the
perspective of data management applications.
