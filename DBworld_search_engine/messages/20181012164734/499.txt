  1st International Conference on Big Scientific Data Management (BigSDM2018)

                         http://bigsdm2018.csdata.org
                    Nov. 30 - Dec. 1, 2018, Beijing, China
             Submission Deadline: September 15th, 2018 (Abstract)
===============================================================================

The 1st International Conference on Big Scientific Data Management (BigSDM
2018) will be held in Beijing, China from Nov. 30th to Dec 1st, 2018. The
Conference is jointly organized by Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Peking
University, Tsinghua University, Renmin University of China, CWI and MonetDB
Solutions.

The theme of BigSDM 2018 is data-driven scientific discovery. The conference
aims at bring together international experts from natural and computer sciences
to explore the life-cycle management of Big Scientific Data, to discuss major
methodologies and key technologies in Big Data-driven discovery making, to
exchange experience and knowledge about Big Scientific Data across various
fields through specific cases, and to identify the challenges and opportunities
in scientific discovery acceleration. We hope to, through the conference,
gather ideas for fostering new ways of scientific thinking, and promote big
data sciences at large.

The program of BigSDM 2018 features several keynote talks by famous experts in
the important areas of big data sciences. We have invited Barry C. Barish, the
winner of 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics, Huadong Guo who is an Academician of
Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Alexander S. Szalay, the bloomberg
distinguished professor from the Johns Hopkins University to share their
cutting edge technology and views about the big scientific data management. In
the meantime, we are about to invite the principal researchers from major
scientific experiments, such as the Five- hundred-meter Aperture Spherical
radio Telescope (FAST), and major data projects, such as 'CASEarth' in China to
share their experiences in data-driven scientific discovery. 'CASEarth' is a
CAS Strategic Pioneering Research and Development Programme, focusing on
building a global big data network to study Earth and support research on
climate change, as well as to predict and mitigate natural disasters. The other
events include topic-specific forums and lightning talks.

BigSDM 2018 welcomes researchers, professionals, practitioners, and officers
worldwide in related areas to submit papers and attend the conference.


==================
TOPICS OF INTEREST
==================

The two-day conference provides an open forum to discuss the opportunities and
challenges of a big scientific data ecosystem, and to explore best practices,
standards, architectures and data infrastructures for fostering
cross-disciplinary discovery and innovation.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Paradigms for enhancing scientific discovery through big data
* Framework for helping the science and AI communities to work together
* Data cleansing and quality assurance of science data
* Data sharing and preservation policy
* Data management challenges posed by big scientific data

* Machine learning methods to facilitate/accelerate scientific discovery
* Streaming data, sensor networks and complex event processing
* Scientific workflow management
* Science platforms: (hardware/software) tools for data discovery and analysis
  from different angles
* Storage system for large scale scientific applications
* Cloud technology for big scientific applications
* Scientific data visualisation
