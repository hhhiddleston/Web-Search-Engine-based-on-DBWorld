**************************************************************************************************

The 13th KIPS International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Technologies and Applications (CUTE 2018) will be held on Dec. 17 - 19, 2018, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
 The purpose of the CUTE 2018 is to promote discussion and interaction among
academics, researchers and professionals in the field of ubiquitous computing
technologies. Ubiquitous computing will require a new approach to fitting
technology to our lives. The advent of new computing devices, and the seamless
connectivity between these devices, thanks to diverse wired and wireless
networks, are enabling new opportunities for a user to perform his/her operation
all the time and everywhere. These seamlessly connected devices are ranging from
mobile handset to wearable computers. Also, it is expected that these devices
will become so pervasive that they will be embedded in the surrounding physical
environment, and transparent and invisible to a user. Such devices, whether
carried on by people or embedded into other systems, will constitute a global
internet working infrastructure and likely to provide a new level of openness and
dynamics. Ubiquitous computing has as its goal the enhancing computer use by
pushing computational services out of conventional desktop interfaces into
physical environments, but effectively making them transparent forms and calm
mode of interactivity. Recent advances in electronic and computer technologies
have paved the way for the proliferation of ubiquitous computing and innovative
applications that incorporate these technologies.
  This conference provides an international forum for the presentation and
showcase of recent advances on various aspects of ubiquitous computing. It will
reflect the state-of-the-art of the computational methods, involving theory,
algorithm, numerical simulation, error and uncertainty analysis and/or novel
application of new processing techniques in engineering, science, and other
disciplines related to ubiquitous computing. In this conference, several topics
on the specific themes for intensive discussions are also planned according to
the areas of interest.

Paper Submission and Publication
-----------------------------------
There will be a combination of presentations including scientific papers. Prospective authors are invited, in the first instance, to submit papers for oral presentations in any of the areas of interest for this conference.
Authors should submit a paper based on page limitation including all figures, tables, and references. If you want to submit more than page limitation, you can add up to 2 extra pages with the appropriate fee payment.


All accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings published by Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering (LNEE) - Springer (indexed by EI and SCOPUS).


Authors should submit a paper with 5~6 pages in length, including all figures, tables, and references. If you want to submit more than page limitation, you can add up to 2 extra pages (total MAX. 8 pages) with the extra page charges (100 USD per page).
Papers exceeding the page limits will be rejected without review.

Instructions for papers in the Springer's LNEE (Note that the paper format of LNEE is the same as that of LNCS)
- Prepare your paper in the exact format as the sample paper for LNEE. Failure to do so may result in the exclusion of your paper from the proceedings. Please read the authors' instructions carefully before preparing your papers.
- Springer accepts both Microsoft Word and LaTex format in the Lecture Note Series. However, FTRA does not accept the use of LaTex. Therefore, you should use the Microsoft Word instead of using LaTex (The paper will be excluded from the proceeding if you use LaTex). Springer provides the relevant templates and sample files for both PC (sv-lncs.dot) and Mac (sv-lncs) environments.
- Please download word.zip (http://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/word.zip?SGWID=0-0-45-72919-0). If you need more help on preparing your papers, please visit Springer's LNCS web page (http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-2-72376-0).
