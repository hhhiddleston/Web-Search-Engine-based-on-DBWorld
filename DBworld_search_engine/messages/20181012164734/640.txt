Call for Papers:

While it is not known for sure how the Fourth Industrial Revolution will take place, it seems like common sense that it is connected with new technologies such as artificial intelligence, autonomous transportation, robotics, Internet of Things (IoT), additive manufacturing, biotechnology and the merging of digital and physical worlds. The Fab Labs are workspaces where people with common interests collaborate and invent using digital fabrication. Today we have more than 1200 Fab Labs around the world and many more maker and hacker spaces. Inside these places we have numerous projects with aim to solve from local issues to global problems. Internet of Things reflects the growing number of smart, connected products and it highlights the new opportunities these products can represent. As computation becomes more ubiquitous and pervasive inside everyday products, the use of AI techniques in IoT and other smart objects embedded with computational capacity become a natural evolution. Thus, this track is interested in how we can use AI to increase the complexity and functionality of products in order to offer better ways to resolve everyday problems and/or creative learning activities.

The goal of this track is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to share their efforts in addressing current issues, challenges, novel approaches, and real-world cases of Artificial Intelligence combining with the Internet of Things or Fab Labs and Maker Spaces Projects, showing potential future applications. Papers and contributions are encouraged for any work relating to AI in Maker Spaces or Internet of Things. Topics of interest may include (but are in no way limited to):

Internet of Things
Creative Learning
Machine Learning
Deep Learning
Wearables
Project-Based Learning
Smart Things
Agents
Computer Vision
Voice Recognition
Speech or Text Recognition
Virtual Reality
Augmented Reality
Mixed/Hybrid Reality
Real World Applications of IoT technology
Case studies of AI techniques applied to IoT
Case studies related to creative learning
Case studies related to AI in Maker Spaces
IoT Security
Emotional Analysis on IoT devices

Note: We invite original papers (i.e. work not previously submitted, in submission, or to be submitted to another conference during the reviewing process).

Important Dates:
    November 19, 2018 - Paper submission deadline
    January 21, 2019 - Paper acceptance notification
    February 25, 2019 - Camera ready version due
 
All accepted papers will be published as FLAIRS proceedings by the AAAI.
