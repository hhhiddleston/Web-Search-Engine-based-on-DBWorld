=========================================================================
IUI 2019 is pleased to invite tutorial proposals. Tutorials offer the community an opportunity to learn about the state-of-the-art concepts and techniques and allow the presenters to share their expertise. We invite proposals from active researchers and practitioners, and experienced presenters. Ideally, a tutorial will cover the state-of-the-art research and development in a specific area strongly related to IUI. Tutorials on interdisciplinary areas, novel or fast growing directions, and significant practical applications are also encouraged. Tutorials will be held in auditoriums with a screen, projector, and Internet connection. Presenters are expected to bring their own computer.

=============== PROPOSAL FORMAT ===============
Each tutorial proposal should provide the following information:
- Name and title: Your name, the tutorial title and the expected length of your tutorial (preferably half a day, i.e. 2 sessions on 90 minutes each).
- Description of tutorial topic and goal: Detailed outline of the tutorial, along with descriptions of the objectives, its relevance to IUI, benefits to the attendees, and course materials/handouts (links to online materials encouraged).
- Organizers: Name, email address, and affiliation of each presenter. Note that each listed presenter must register for the conference and be present at the tutorial.
- Target audience and prerequisites: Target audience level (introductory, intermediate, advanced) and prerequisite knowledge or skills.
