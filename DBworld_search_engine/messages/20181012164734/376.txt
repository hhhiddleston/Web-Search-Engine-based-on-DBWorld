CALL FOR PAPERS
LARGE, HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS (LHNA)
Watching streaming videos, uploading pictures and using cloud-based services will make high demands on mobile networks. At the same time more devices will be connected. Heterogeneous Networks, involving a mix of radio technologies and cell types working together seamlessly, will play an important role to service data hungry smartphones, especially in crowded areas.
The "Large, Heterogenous Networks and their Applications" (LHNA) track aims at promoting original and unpublished research 
works covering emerging and novel concepts, technologies, applications for categories related to large and heterogeneous 
networks. This includes issues related to radio (4/5G) and large wireless networks, traffic management, complex graphs, semantic Web, Big Data, and network security. 

Topics of interest for track LHNA
Large Network Analysis - methods, algorithms, processes, analytic tools
* Graph processing / manipulation
* Usage / implementation of Big Data algorithms
* Avoiding fragmentation of the network graph 
* Dynamics and evolution patterns of social networks, trend prediction
* Information broadcasting in Social Networks

Social analytic tools
* Approaches based on Semantic Web Technologies
* Ontologies for managing social networks
* Social networks and cultural information
* Social Network Analysis of Terrorist Networks
