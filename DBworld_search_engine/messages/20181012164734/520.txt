The ACM SIGMOD Second Workshop on Data Management for End-to-End Machine Learning (DEEM) was successfully held last June in Houston, TX. The goal of DEEM is to bring together researchers and practitioners at the intersection of applied machine learning (ML) and data management/systems research to discuss data management/systems issues in ML systems and applications. Arun Kuman, co-organizer of the workshop, gives an overview of DEEM'18 and a lighthearted summary of the exciting and informative panel discussion on the topic of "ML/AI Systems and Applications: Is the SIGMOD/VLDB Community Losing Relevance?".
