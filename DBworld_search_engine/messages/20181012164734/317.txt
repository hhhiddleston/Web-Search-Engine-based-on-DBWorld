ACM SAC 2019 is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP) and is hosted by
University of Cyprus, Cyprus.

SEMANTIC WEB AND APPLICATIONS TRACK CALL FOR PAPERS
http://cis.csi.cuny.edu/sac/swa2019/
The technical track "The Semantic Web and Applications (SWA)" focuses on the topics related to 
Semantic Web Technologies and their Applications. The techniques to realize and/or utilize 
the Semantic Web are discussed in this track. 
The focus of this track is to present research concerning issues such as: 1) learning/constructing ontologies 
for Semantic Web applications; 2) utilizing ontologies for data management, integration and interoperability 
in Semantic web applications; 3) architectures for achieving Semantic Web goals for specific application domains; 
and 4) improving search techniques (or engines) with Semantic Web technologies. 
This track aims to tackle research problems and practical applications for the Semantic Web. 
Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit papers on the theoretical, technical and practical issues 
of Semantic Web and its Applications. We are particularly interested in applying Semantic Web technologies 
to specific application domains (e.g., e-learning, e-business, social network, geographic information system, 
medical informatics and bioinformatics).

Topics include, but are not limited to:

Semantic Big Data
Semantic interoperability
Ontology-enabled interoperability among e-sources
Emergent semantics
Ontology, Taxonomy, and Folksonomy
Schema mapping/matching and integration
Learning structures from the Web for Semantic Web-enabled applications
Ontology generation/learning

SUBMISSION PROCEDURES
Research Paper Submission site: https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2019/submission.html
SRC Submission site: https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2019/submission_src.html
Author Kit: https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2019/authorkit.html

Authors are invited to submit original papers in PDF format. 
Since the track papers will be published by ACM proceedings, 
authors must submit manuscripts using the ACM format. 
See ACM SAC author kit (https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2019/authorkit.html) for template files and details.

Regular papers are limited to 8 pages, in camera-ready format, included in the registration fee. 
Authors have the option to include up to two (2) extra pages at additional fee of US$80 per page.
Posters are limited to 3 pages, in camera-ready format, included in the registration fee. 
Authors have the option to include only one (1) extra page at additional fee of US$80. 
SRC Abstracts are limited to 2 pages, in camera-ready format, included in the registration fee. No extra pages allowed. 
The author(s) name(s) and address(es) must NOT appear in the body of the paper, and self-reference 
should be in the third person. This is to facilitate blind review. 
Only the title should be shown on the top of the first page without the author's information.
A paper cannot be submitted to more than one track.
All paper submissions MUST BE "Original, unpublished work."
Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of the paper/poster in the conference proceedings. 
An author or a proxy attending SAC MUST present the paper. This is a requirement for the paper/poster 
to be included in the ACM/IEEE digital library. No-show of scheduled papers and posters will result in 
excluding them from the ACM/IEEE digital library.

STUDENT RESEARCH COMPETITION 
As before, SAC 2019 organizes a Student Research Competition (SRC) Program to provide graduate students 
the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas with researchers and practitioners in their areas of interest. 
Submission to the SRC program should be in electronic form via The Student Research Abstract SUBMISSION page 
(https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2019/submission_src.html) in the conference web site as a PDF file.
