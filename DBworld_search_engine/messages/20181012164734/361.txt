Call for Contributions
----------------------
Fog computing is the extension of cloud computing into its edge and the physical world to meet the data volume and decision velocity requirements in many emerging applications, such as augmented and virtual realities (AR/VR), cyber-physical systems (CPS), intelligent and autonomous systems, and mission-critical systems. The boundary between centralized, powerful computing cloud and massively distributed, Internet connected sensors, actuators, and things is blurred in this new computing paradigm.

The ICFC 2019 technical program will feature tutorials, workshops, and research paper sessions. We solicit high-quality contributions in the above categories. Details of submission is available on the conference Web site. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

* System architecture for fog computing
* Coordination between cloud, fog, and sensing/actuation endpoints
* Connectivity, storage, and computation in the edge
* Data processing and management for fog computing
* Efficient and embedded AI in the fog
* System and network manageability
* Middleware and coordination platforms
* Power, energy, and resource management
* Device and hardware support for fog computing
* Programming models, abstractions, and software engineering for fog computing
* Security, privacy, and ethics issues related to fog computing
* Theoretical foundations and formal methods for fog computing systems
* Applications and experiences
