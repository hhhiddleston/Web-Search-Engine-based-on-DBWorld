! PhD / Postdoc Positions in AI + Big Datacube Research
!

The Large-Scale Scientific Information Systems (L-SIS) research group [1] is
seeking excellent candidates for fully funded Computer Science PhD / Postdoc 
research in the area of connecting AI to Array Databases [2] (aka "Datacubes"
[3]), starting immediately based on grants recently obtained.

We have invented Datacubes and Array Databases back in 1992 [4], and since then
are leading this rapidly growing field in the domains of science and engineering;
our Array DBMS implementation, rasdaman [5], is commercialized successfully and
proven on multi-Petabyte assets served by superscale scientific and commercial
data centers. Our worldwide collaborations include NASA and ESA, the European
Space Agency, as well as international industry.

Further, our group has written the forthcoming ISO SQL MDA ("Multi-Dimensional
Arrays") standard, likewise the Earth datacube standards of OGC and ISO [6].

You bring along: strong background in Computer Science, Linear Algebra, and
Numerics; rock-solid programming skills; engagement, endurance, and interest
in research and publication; business-fluent English reading and writing.
Note that German language skills are not required.

Interested? Contact Peter BAUMANN (p.baumann + jacobs-university.de) by
emailing a motivation letter, CV, transcript copies, and at least one reference.
