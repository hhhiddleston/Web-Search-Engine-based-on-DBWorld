The current industry trend of convergence between computing and networking
eco-systems clearly shows that software will play an unprecedented dominant role
also in future communication environments. Computing, storage, and connectivity
services, as well as any other present and future application instances, will be
deployed in the form of virtualized assets within a software-defined
infrastructure running on top of general-purpose processing and communication
hardware, all managed and made available under the cloud â€œAs A Serviceâ€
paradigm. This technological convergence and infrastructure sharing between the
computing and communication systems portend a scenario with a â€œfogâ€ of
micro-clouds composed of generalized virtual functions providing both
applications and network services that supplement those deployed in traditional
cloud datacenters.

The Fourth IEEE Workshop on Orchestration for Software-Defined Infrastructures
(O4SDI) addresses the challenges that will facilitate orchestration and
programmability of generalized virtual functions in Software Defined
Infrastructures (SDI), enabling cloud and network providers to deploy integrated
services across different resource domains. Orchestration mechanisms will
facilitate the live deployment and lifecycle management of these virtual
elements, at the application level, the server level, and the network level
within a single domain and across multiple domains. Without such orchestration
it will not be possible to enable dynamic establishment of generalized virtual
functions chains, according to service requirements.

These challenges of orchestration are many-fold, with many open questions that
need to be addressed in the areas of:

â— network â€œsoftwarization,â€ which requires unified management of computing,
storage, and network resources for the effective deployment, lifecycle
management, and run-time configuration of generalized virtual functions;

â— abstraction models and open standard interfaces, needed for assuring vendor
interoperability;

â— adaptation and optimization mechanisms, which must be enforced at global
and/or local level for coping with user demand, application requirements,
resource unavailability, etc.

O4SDI aims at providing an international forum for researchers and practitioners
from academia, industry, network operators, and service providers to discuss and
address the challenges deriving from such emerging scenario where systems,
processes, and workflows used in both computing and communications domains are
converging. The workshop welcomes contributions from both computing and
network-oriented research communities, with the aim of facilitating discussion,
cross-fertilization and exchange of ideas and practices, and successfully
promote innovative solutions toward a real programmatic use of software-defined
infrastructures as a whole. Contributions that discuss lessons learnt and best
practices, describe practical deployment and implementation experiences, and
demonstrate innovative use-cases are especially encouraged for presentation and
publication.

We are particularly interested in papers that cover, but are not
limited to, the following topics: 
 
â— single domain and cross domain orchestration issues
â— orchestration of distributed clouds (including fog/edge computing environments)
â— integrated network and computing resource control and management
â— description, specification, and abstraction languages for orchestration and
  context-awareness
â— control and abstraction of heterogeneous networks
â— orchestration in SDN/NFV
â— run-time orchestration
â— QoS/QoE in software-defined infrastructures
â— orchestration for high-availability and resilience in software-defined
  infrastructures
â— orchestration of network slices and data center slices
â— software engineering and operating systems techniques applied to orchestration
â— optimal orchestration algorithms
â— AI techniques for network orchestration and automation
â— context-aware orchestration
â— functional architectures of orchestrating elements
â— testbed experiments on orchestrations
â— performance evaluation of orchestration elements
â— standardization issues in orchestration
â— network programmability for service chaining
â— dynamic service composition and delivery
