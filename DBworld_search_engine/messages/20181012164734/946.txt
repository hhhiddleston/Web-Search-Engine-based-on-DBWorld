Dear Colleagues,

we are very happy to welcome new contributions for the next
GEOProcessing events, coming to ATHENS, GREECE, in 2019!

Thank you so much for the excellent contributions so far and for the
support from all participants, speakers, panelists, committees,
peer reviewers, and all the other contributors
and volunteers! Your contributions and support have made the
GEOProcessing conferences very successful and most lively events
over more than ten years!

Please consider to contribute to The Eleventh International Conference on
Advanced Geographic Information Systems, Applications, and Services
(GEOProcessing 2019) and events and/or forward to your colleagues
and to the appropriate groups.

GEOProcessing 2019 continues a successful series of events
dedicated to advanced geographic information systems, applications,
and services, covering academic and industrial achievements and visions
in the geoscientific disciplines.

Geographical sensors and satellites provide a huge volume of spatial data which
is available on the Web. Making use of Web Services, the users are able for
provisioning and using these services instead of only for document searching.
These services are published in a directory and may be automatically discovered
in a given context by software agents.
Accessing large digital geographical libraries with geo-spatial information
raises some challenges with respect to data semantics, interfaces, data accuracy
and updates, distributed processing, as well as with discovery, indexing and
integration of geographical information systems; this raise the issue of
distributed catalogs forming a federation of
spatial databases. Some spatial data infrastructures use service-oriented
architecture for accessing these large databases via Web Services.

Tracks feature application scenarios, state of the art, and outreach
developments and span from geo-spatial fundamentals to visualusation,
modeling and simulation, digital cartography data,
earth geo-observation and sensing as well as geo-data processing
and advanced application as from seismic data processing,
planetology, geophysics, exploration to near surface method
and archaeology application, data and knowledge management scenarios.

The conference brings together world's leading international experts, researchers,
computational scientists, developers, system managers, users, students, and
industry and business affiliates for sharing experiences, publishing and presenting
new research results and discussing recent developments, challenges, and future
advancements and collaboration in exciting expert panels, workshops, symposia, and tutorials.

In this context, in addition to the Call for Submissions
please also note the chance for proposals on
tutorials, panels, workshops, and symposia.

Wish you all the best with your research and beyond!

Looking forward to your contributions and hopefully seeing you in Athens!

Kind regards,
Dr. Claus-Peter Rueckemann
General Chair and Chair of the GEOProcessing Steering Committee
