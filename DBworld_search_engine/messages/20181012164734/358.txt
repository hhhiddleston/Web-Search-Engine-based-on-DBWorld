The ICDE 2019 Industry and Applications Track will feature high quality submissions describing new systems or new techniques in all areas of data management and engineering as well as innovative and demanding application scenarios. The Industry and Applications Track allows for a focus on technological solutions as well as encouraging core, industry-based applications papers. The ICDE 2019 Industry and Applications Track will emphasize submissions that describe innovative industrial advancements in relevant areas including (but not limited to) database and data management systems, scalable machine learning and data mining systems, stream data processing, information retrieval, knowledge discovery, data quality and cleaning, information integration, cloud-based systems, mobile data management, data systems on new hardware. Submissions that do not articulate the innovative aspect of a product or application project (including relevant open source software), but rather give a general overview, are discouraged.

The Industry and Applications Track will accept short (6 pages) as well as long (12 pages) submissions.
