Track on Social Network and Media Analysis (SONAMA)
The 34rd ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC 2019)
 
April 8 -12, 2019, Limassol, Cyprus

Aims and Scope
---------------

With the advent of social network services such as Twitter, Facebook, 
Tumbler, and Google+, the research on social network and media analysis 
has been greatly advanced. In recent years, the interactions among people, 
sharing of knowledge and experiences, community activities in social 
network services increase greatly, which would make the research on social 
networks more important. Furthermore, as social media contents within 
social network services are rapidly being produced and consumed, the social 
media contents now account for the majority of content published on the 
world wide web. Social media is differentiated from traditional media in 
many aspects such as its frequency, quality, usability, immediacy, and
permanence, which leads to significant potential to the social media 
analysis research. 
 
The ACM SAC has been an important venue for the past 33 years, 
attracting computer scientists, computer engineers, software engineers, 
and application developers from around the world. The Social Network and 
Media Analysis (SONAMA) track of ACM SAC will provide a forum that brings 
together researchers and practitioners for exploring technologies, issues, 
experiences, and applications with a specific focus on the recent research 
trends and industrial needs in the related fields. Since social network and 
media analysis encompasses a variety of highly cross-disciplinary research 
issues, the SONAMA will foster collaborations and exchange of ideas and 
experiences among researchers working in various fields such as computer 
science, linguistics, statistics, sociology, economics, and business.

Important Dates
---------------
Paper submission: September 10, 2018
Acceptance notification: November 10, 2018
Camera-ready copies: November 25, 2018
Author registration: December 10, 2018 

 
Submission Guidelines
---------------------
Authors are invited to submit original and unpublished papers of research and applications for this track. Full papers are limited to 8 pages with the option for up to 2 additional pages. The author(s) name(s) and address(es) must not appear in the body of the paper, and self-reference should be in the third person. This is to facilitate double-blind review. Only the title should be shown at the first page without the author's information. Papers must be formatted according to the ACM SAC template. Papers that received high reviews but were not accepted due to space limitations can be invited for the poster session. Posters are limited to 3 pages with the option for up to only additional page. For full submission guidelines, please follow the instructions on the ACM SAC 2019 website. Please submit your contribution via SAC 2019 Web page. 



Registration
---------------------
Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of the paper/poster in the conference proceedings. An author or a proxy attending SAC MUST present the paper. This is a requirement for the paper/poster to be included in the ACM digital library. No-show of scheduled papers and posters will result in excluding them from the ACM digital library.



Student Research Competition (SRC) Program 
------------------------------------------
Graduate students are invited to submit research abstracts (maximum of 4 pages in ACM camera-ready format) following the instructions published at SAC 2019 website. Submission of the same abstract to multiple tracks is not allowed. All research abstract submissions will be reviewed by expert reviewers and practitioners. Authors of selected abstracts will have the opportunity to give poster presentations of their work and compete for three top-winning places. The SRC committee will evaluate and select the first-, second-, and third-place winners. The winners will receive medals and cash awards. Winners will be announced during the conference banquet. Authors of selected abstracts are eligible to apply to the SIGAPP Student Travel Award program for financial support. Please submit your contribution via SAC 2019 Web page.
