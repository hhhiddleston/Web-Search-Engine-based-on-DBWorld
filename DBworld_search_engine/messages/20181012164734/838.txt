***************************************************************************

AIMS:

TPNC is a conference series intending to cover the wide spectrum of computational principles, models and techniques inspired by information processing in nature. TPNC 2018 will reserve significant room for young scholars at the beginning of their career and particular focus will be put on methodology. The conference aims at attracting contributions to nature-inspired models of computation, synthesizing nature by means of computation, nature-inspired materials, and information processing in nature.

VENUE:

TPNC 2018 will take place in Dublin, a major historical and contemporary centre for education, arts, administration, economy and industry. The venue will be:

Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School
University College Dublin
Carysfort Avenue
Blackrock
Co. Dublin
http://www.smurfitschool.ie/

SCOPE:

Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Theoretical contributions to:

artificial chemistry
artificial immune systems
artificial life
cellular automata
cognitive computing
cognitive engineering
cognitive robotics
collective behaviour
complex systems
computational intelligence
