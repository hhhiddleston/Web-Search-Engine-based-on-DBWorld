CALL FOR PAPERS

The 16th IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI)
November 9-11, 2018, Miami, Florida, USA

DUE DATE: JULY 20, 2018

Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI) research is an interdisciplinary research field involving academic researchers in information technologies, computer science, public policy, bioinformatics, computational social science, social computing, medical informatics, and social and behavioural studies as well as local, state, and federal law enforcement and intelligence experts, and information technology industry consultants and practitioners to support counterterrorism and homeland securityÕs missions of anticipation, interdiction, prevention, preparedness and response to terrorist acts.
The annual IEEE International Conference on ISI (IEEE ISI) was started in 2003 in Tucson, Arizona. Since then, the conference has been hosted in Atlanta, San Diego, New Brunswick, Taipei, Dallas, Vancouver, Beijing, Seattle, Washington DC, the Hague, Baltimore, Tucson, and Beijing. Over the past 15 years, the IEEE ISI Conference has evolved from its traditional orientation of intelligence and security domain towards a more integrated alignment of multiple domains, including technology, humans, organization, and security. The scientific community has increasingly recognized the need to address intelligence and security threats by understanding the interrelationships between these different components, and by integrating recent advances from different domains. This year, the IEEE ISI conference will be held in Miami, Florida, USA.
CONFERENCE TOPICS
We invite academic researchers in the field of Intelligence and Security Informatics and related areas as well as law enforcement and intelligence experts, and industryÊconsultants and practitioners in the field to submit papers and workshop proposals.
