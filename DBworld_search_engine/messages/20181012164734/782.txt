++Aims and Scope++
DILS provides a forum for the discussion of data management on the life sciences, including open problems and technical solutions for integration, query processing, and analytics. In particular, the thirteenth edition of DILS will focus on Big life science data coming from diverse data sources, e.g., genomic data collections, biomedical literature, or clinical records, and in the challenges for transforming Big data into actionable insights.

++Topics of Interests and Research Areas++
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Challenges and opportunities with big, complex or heterogeneous life science data
Life science data integration and management  
Authenticity, privacy, security, and trust in life science data
Knowledge graphs from life science data
Knowledge representation and discovery from life science data 
Knowledge extraction for life science data
Ontology mappings and evolution
Quality assurance in integrated life science repositories
Architectures and data management techniques for the life sciences
Query processing and optimization 
Question answering over life science data
Exposing life science data (APIs, Linked Open Data, SPARQL endpoints)
Metadata and Provenance Management of life science repositories
Analytics of large-scale life science data
Ethical, legal and social issues with biomedical data integration.
Data integration challenges and applications in various life-sciences
Applications using and managing Big life science data


Industry papers, demos, posters, and application/experiences are also welcome to DILS 2018. 
They will be selected according to industry-compliant assessment criteria. 
Furthermore, descriptions of European Projects in the Life Sciences can be also submitted. 

++Paper Submission and Publication++

Authors are invited to submit original contributions of technical rigor and practical relevance to DILS 2018. Four types of papers will be selected: 
 -) Full research papers (up to 15 pages) 
 -) Short research papers (8 pages) 
 -) Industry/application/experience papers (8 pages) 
 -) Demos and Posters (4 pages)
 -) Description of European Projects in the Life Sciences (2 pages) 
References are not counted in the page limit. Please, include in the title of the paper the type of submission.

Papers are to be prepared using LNCS templates 
The proceedings of DILS will be published by Springer in the LNCS/LNAI/LNBI (Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics).
