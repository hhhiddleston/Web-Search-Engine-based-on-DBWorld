FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS:

The 21st International Conference on Principles and Practice of
Multi-Agent Systems (PRIMA 2018)
October 29 - November 2, 2018
AIST Tokyo Waterfront, Tokyo, Japan
http://2018.prima-conference.org/
***************************************************************************

Software systems are becoming more intelligent in the kind of
functionality they offer users. At the same time, systems are becoming
more decentralized, with components that represent autonomous entities
who must communicate among themselves to achieve their goals. Examples
of such systems range from healthcare and emergency relief and
disaster management to e-business and smarts grids. A multiagent
worldview is crucial to properly conceptualizing, building, and
governing such systems. It offers abstractions such as intelligent
agent, protocol, norm, organization, trust, incentive, and so on, and
is rooted in solid computational and software engineering foundations.
As a large but still growing research field of Computer Science,
multiagent systems today remain a unique enabler of interdisciplinary
research.

=======================
Information for Authors
=======================
The PRIMA 2018 Program Committee invites submissions of original,
unpublished, theoretical and applied work strongly relevant to
multiagent systems, including reports on the development of prototype
and deployed agent systems, and of experiments that demonstrate novel
agent system capabilities. An indicative list of topics is provided
below.

The papers can be submitted to one of the following categories:
- Regular papers: These papers can be up to 16 pages in length in the
  Springer LNCS format. Note that some regular papers may be accepted as
  short papers.
- Short papers: These papers can be up to 8 pages in length in the
  Springer LNCS format. These 'early-innovation' papers will be reviewed
  with an emphasis on novelty/originality of the idea.

Note that all the submitted papers must be in a form suitable for
double-blind review. In order to make blind reviewing possible,
authors must omit their names and affiliations from the paper.

All accepted papers will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in
Artificial Intelligence series (LNCS/LNAI).

=======================
Special Issue
=======================
Selected papers will also be invited to submit an extended version to
a fast track of the Journal of Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems
(JAAMAS).
