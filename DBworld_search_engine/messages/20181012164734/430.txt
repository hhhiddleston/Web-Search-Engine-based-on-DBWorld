DESCRIPTION
=============================================
Cloud computing, virtualization and virtual (eScience) applications are currently hot topics and have been generating substantial interest in the community, and it is anticipated that this interest will expand. It is also important to the research community as it is challenging traditional methods by its sheer size and high level of automation. Clouds must provide appropriate levels of performance to large groups of diverse users, and those clouds are accessed through virtualized wide area networks. Management systems are essential for that and thereby for the future success of the cloud paradigm. New systems, methods, and approaches for cloud, virtualization and (eScience) applications management are to be discussed at this workshop.
For the CloudAM 2018 workshop, researchers from Clouds and (eScience) Applications communities are encouraged to submit and present original work to be considered for publication. Overall topics of interest include but are not limited to: 
* Cloud computing environments
* Cloud service orchestration
* Cloud APIs and usage control
* Cloud data management
* Cloud scalable monitoring
* Cloud load balancing
* Multi-cloud/Inter-clouds 
* Customer cloud management
* Managing data centers
* Management as a service
* Management of virtual slices
* *aaS Management
* Application and Management Portals
* Cloud scheduling
* Hybrid clouds
* Fog computing
* Cloud case studies
* Cloud surveys and taxonomies
* Social clouds 
* Accounting and economic models for clouds
* Managing cloud services
