Every year, hundreds of tourism academics, industry representatives,
government officials, students and entrepreneurs come together to share,
discuss and challenge latest developments in information technology in the
fields of travel, tourism and hospitality. With the theme "eTourism: Towards
a Sustainable Digital Society" the ENTER 2019 conference will focus on
exploring the ways in which technology and tourism together can make our
society more sustainable. We call for latest research and case studies on
emergent and cutting-edge information and communication technology
concepts, applications, and business models to be shared in the conference.

Organized by the International Federation for Information Technology and
Travel & Tourism (IFITT), the ENTER 2019 conference provides a unique
venue for various tourism stakeholders to understand the application of
information and communication technologies to travel and tourism, with a
special focus on how eTourism can contribute to the sustainability of the
society. The ENTER 2019 research track is divided into three major topics
that all contribute to our capabilities in building a sustainable digital society:
Tourism Business and Technology, Governance, Sustainability and Education,
and Computer Science and Information Systems.

Welcoming Academics and the Industry

The conference brings together the research community and industry, and
it is organized in three streams, namely industry track, destinations track,
and research track. If you are representing tourism industry or destinations,
please see suitable calls for presentations at https://www.enter2019.org .
The conference also features six to eight world-class keynote speakers
discussing the most pressing topics within eTourism.


Location

The 26th edition of ENTER will take place in Nicosia, Cyprus. Nicosia is the
capital of Cyprus; a status it has enjoyed for 1000 years since the 10th
century, though its beginnings date back 5000 years to the Bronze Age.
Nicosia is a sophisticated and cosmopolitan city, rich in history and culture
that combines its historic past with the amenities of a modern city. Cyprus
is an island drenched in sun and mythology, at the crossroads of ancient
civilizations. 9,000 years of history gathered on one island. Cyprus packs a
remarkable array of sights and attractions, museums and archaeological
parks, throbbing beach resorts, pine covered mountains, medieval fortresses
and ancient temples. Over the last few years, it has become one of the top
touristic European destinations breaking in consecutive years the record of
tourist arrivals. It is expected that in 2018, more than 3.6 million tourists
will visit Cyprus and plans target a steady intake of 5 million tourists per
year. More information about Nicosia and Cyprus as well as what the island
and its capital offer can be found on the conference web site.


Call for Research Papers

We invite research papers across the widest spectrum of Information and
Communication Technologies in Travel and Tourism to be presented at the
ENTER 2019 conference. All submissions to the research track are rigorously
evaluated for novelty, significance, and soundness. Papers should clearly
state the background, introduction, purpose, theory, methodology, results,
conclusions and managerial/industry/social implications of the study, and
be fully referenced with appropriate citations. The authors of full papers
and research notes will have the opportunity to present their research orally
supported by PowerPoint slides. Full technical details will be provided with
the acceptance of the paper.

The proceedings of recently held ENTER conferences are listed by ISI's
Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S). ENTER 2019
proceedings will follow a similar indexing process for ISI and other major
indices.

A)     Full Papers

Full papers should be innovative, so to advance the knowledge base of
related fields. These papers present major contributions to the field and
should be up to 12 pages in length. The conference proceedings
https://www.springer.com/la/book/9783319729220 (to be published by
Springer International Publishing) will include all accepted full papers. An
award for the best full paper will be presented during the conference.

B)     Research Notes

Research notes of up to 5 pages are invited. These papers represent new
ideas not developed enough at the scale of a full paper, findings that restate
known research, descriptions of prototypes, or research that is limited in
scope. All research notes will be published by the e-Review of Tourism
Research (eRTR) at http://ertr.tamu.edu/ (Editor of eRTR: Cody Morris Paris,
Middlesex University Dubai, United Arab Emirates).

C)    Organized Sessions

Proposals for organizing technical or other research-oriented sessions are
invited. Proposals will include details of potential participants, topics, and
presenters. Session Chairs are expected to attend ENTER 2019, set the order
of presentations, and chair their session/s. Deadline for session chairs to
submit their proposals to Research Track Chairs is September 3, 2018
(please submit proposal by e-mail to the research track chairs found at the
