CloudWays2018: 4th International Workshop on Cloud Migration and Architecture 2018

Como, Italy, September 12, 2018

Conference website https://sites.google.com/site/cloudwaysws18/

Submission link https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cloudways2018

Submission deadline July 28, 2018

The 4th International Workshop on Cloud Migration and Architecture (CloudWays 2018) aims to bring together cloud migration experts and cloud-native application DevOps experts from academia and industry from different IT communities, e.g., cloud computing, software engineering, services computing, big data, information systems, etc. Its main goals is to promote discussions and collaboration among participants, to help disseminate novel cloud migration practices and solutions, and to identify future cloud migration and cloud-native application engineering challenges and dimensions. To this end, the workshop will foster a more interactive participation model, in which authors, invited speakers and attendees will be encouraged to socially engage beyond the planned workshop activities.

CloudWays 2018 will be co-located with the 7th European Conference on Service-Oriented and Cloud Computing (ESOCC 2018). 

Submission Guidelines

All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. The following paper categories are welcome:

- Full papers (maximum 12 pages) should describe original research, empirical studies or experience reports on cloud architectures, adoption and migration.
- Short papers (maximum 8 pages) should describe on-going research or early empirical results.

All papers must be written in English and follow Springer's LNCS formatting instructions.  Papers must be submitted in PDF using the EasyChair online submission system.

The workshop proceedings are planned as post-proceedings in the Springer CCIS Series covering all ESOCC satellite events.
