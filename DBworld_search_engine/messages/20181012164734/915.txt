      Intersession Management and Remote Therapeutic Intervention Support

Many studies have confirmed that therapeutic interventions constitute a 
fundamental part of most therapies as they increase their efficacy. The 
variety of therapeutic interventions, in turn, ranges from simple medication 
intakes up to complex behavioral therapies including homework, which is 
assigned by a therapist to the patient. In particular, homework supports 
therapeutic progress and helps to transfer therapeutic achievements from 
the clinical setting to the real-life situation of the patient at home. 
Taking this diversity into account, many therapists crave for a more 
sophisticated IT support. In line with this trend, recent studies revealed 
that (1) utilizing smart mobile devices are demanded by therapists and (2) 
that they can be used to obtain new insights in clinical research. However, 
existing approaches still come with several drawbacks. First, they mainly 
provide specifically tailored applications and often do not cope with the 
diversity of therapeutic interventions. Second, they neither consider the 
execution context of homework properly nor the provision of feedback. Third, 
existing solutions focus on the therapist-patient relationship and, therefore, 
neglect emerging opportunities (e.g., context-sensitive data) in this context.  
Fourth, features provided by current smart mobile devices (e.g., sensors) have 
seldomly been used for therapeutic interventions. More generally, the development 
of information systems, which support homework in the context of therapeutic 
interventions and intersession management has not been sufficiently addressed 
so far. When realizing information systems that integrate, for example, smart 
mobile devices, the common procedure of therapeutic interventions in general 
and homework in particular must be carefully captured by the system. Therefore, 
relevant requirements must be elicited in real-world projects. Based on such 
requirements, new IT platform approaches enabling therapists to manage therapeutic 
interventions remotely can be designed and realized. Using such platforms, 
homework can be created, for example, with a web-based component and be performed 
by patients with the help of, for example, smart mobile devices. Moreover, beyond 
the technical issues when capturing remote therapeutic interventions and intersession 
management digitally, many interdisciplinary questions arise, which need to be 
addressed. For example, what about ethical aspects, privacy issues, or evolving 
demands of therapists.  Therefore, the aim of this special issue is the investigation 
of challenges, opportunities, and new questions when addressing intersession management 
and remote therapeutic interventions by adding IT-support to these environments. To 
be more precise, the following research questions, inter alia, shall be addressed by 
this Special Issue:

-What are the drawbacks and limitations of IT-supported therapeutic interventions?
-What means sensor usage in this context?
-Can we derive new insights into the performance of intersession management and remote therapeutic interventions?
-What are the general risks of IT-support in this context?
-What means context-awareness in this environment?
-What constitutes a suitable IT-support in this context?
-Which new medical issues arise?
-Which new psychological issues arise?
-What are the demands of therapists?
-What are the demands of patients?
-What about legal and ethical aspects in this context?
-What means feedback in this context?
-What means data quality in this context?
-What are the core features of a comprehensive IT-supported intersession management?

This Special Issue aims to provide a comprehensive overview of new approaches and disruptive 
ideas for an IT-Support of intersession management and remote therapeutic interventions. We 
invite research articles that will consolidate our understanding of the state-of-the-art in 
this area. The Special Issue will publish full research, review, and highly rated manuscripts 
addressing the above issues, including any of the topics mentioned in the keywords listed here:

About MDPI J
=====================================================================================
J (ISSN 2571-8800) is an international, peer-reviewed, multidisciplinary, open access 
journal, which provides an advanced forum for high-quality original research across the 
entire range of natural, applied, social, and formal sciences. J is dedicated to publishing 
all types of research outputs, including negative and confirmatory results in all disciplines 
and to make these results available to the relevant scientific communities shortly after 
peer-review. Our goal is to improve fast dissemination of new research results and ideas, 
and to allow research groups to build new studies, innovations and knowledge without delay. 
Manuscripts submitted to J will undergo basic editorial checks (including for plagiarism) 
by an in-house editor before being sent for peer-review. Reviewers will be asked to 
evaluate only the soundness of the research approach, to detect the presence of any major 
flaws, and to make a recommendation regarding publication. They can choose between 
acceptance, minor revision or rejection, but only according to the validity of the 
scientific content. The significance of the contributions will be assessed by the 
appropriate scientific community at large, not by the two reviewers or the academic 
editor. We encourage scientists to publish their experimental and theoretical results 
in as much detail as possible so there is no restriction on the length of the papers. 
The full experimental details must be provided so that the results can be reproduced. 
Electronic files and software providing supportive details of calculations or experimental 
procedures can also be deposited as supplementary electronic material.

Submission Guidelines
=====================================================================================

Manuscripts should be submitted online at www.mdpi.com by registering and 
logging in to this website. Once you are registered, click here to go to the 
submission form. Manuscripts can be submitted until the deadline. All papers 
will be peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the 
journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue 
website. Research articles, review articles as well as short communications are 
invited. For planned papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words) can 
be sent to the Editorial Office for announcement on this website.

Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under 
consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference proceedings papers). 
All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a single-blind peer-review 
process. A guide for authors and other relevant information for submission 
of manuscripts is available on the Instructions for Authors page. J is an 
international peer-reviewed open access quarterly journal published by MDPI.
