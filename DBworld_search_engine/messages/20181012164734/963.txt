WELCOME

Welcome to the 6th International Conference on Enterprise Systems.
Enterprise Systems (ES), also referred to as Enterprise Information Systems,
has become increasingly popular over the last 20 years because it integrates
and extends business processes across the boundaries of business functions
and corporate walls, as well as country border lines. The International
Conference on Enterprise Systems (ES) has been held every year since 2013.
The sixth in the series will be held at St. Raphael Resort, Limassol, Cyprus,
1-2 October, 2018. The conference is hosted by the Department of Computer
Science, University of Cyprus.

This conference series is focusing on both the technical and application
aspects of enterprise systems, the complex and cross-disciplinary
problems of enterprise integration, and the new technological frontiers
such as Industrial Integration, Industrial Information Integration, and
Industry 4.0. The objectives of the conference are to provide high quality
research and professional interactions for the advancement of science
and technology. The main features of the conference include Keynote
Speeches, Regular and Special Sessions. It has been highlighted by the
IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society: http://ieeesmc.org/ .


SCOPE

We welcome original and survey articles about the latest advances of
technology. The final results can be state-of-the-art, requirements,
fundamental theories, models, frameworks, algorithms, methodologies,
platforms, protocols, prototypes, testbeds, field trials, case
studies/stories, field experiences, standardization efforts, regulatory
activities, education and training innovations, etc. The application
areas include aeronautics and astronautics, agriculture, automotive,
building, construction, energy, finance, healthcare, logistics, manufacturing,
process industry, power, transportation, etc.
