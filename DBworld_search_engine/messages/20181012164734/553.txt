Call for Student Proof of Concept Competition

IEEE CCEM 2018 Student PoC Competition

IEEE Cloud Computing for Emerging Markets (CCEM) Conference will host a student proof-of concept competi-tion. This contest offers an opportunity for under-graduate and graduate students to analyze how cloud computing can be leveraged to assuage problems afflicting emerging markets. The top ideas will be short-listed and given the opportunity to be showcased at IEEE CCEM 2018.

How to Participate
1.Identify a problem that is plaguing citizens of emerging economies and analyze how cloud computing can alleviate that obstacle. An example would be to use the power of hybrid clouds to render e-governance of public village sanitation malpractice-free. Another example could be to design a novel way to improve the concept of DigiLockers being implemented by the Indian Government to pave way for secure paperless transactions. Look at these schemes launched by the Government of India (http://www.pradhanmantriyojana.co.in/) for more topic ideas.
2.Develop cloud computing based theory to address the chosen challenge and write a high-level proposal, algorithmically laying out your approach.
3.Develop a proof-of-concept to demonstrate that your approach is viable.
4.Upload your entry to the IEEE CCEM Student PoC Competition webpage. 
 Your submission should be a single 9-page PDF file (in 11pt font - double column - following IEEE Paper submission guidelines) comprising of: •A 3-page PoC brief that describes your design approach along with an embedded hyperlink to a 5-minute youtube video showcasing the PoC. 
Note 1:  The PoC brief should include (a) Title (b) Participants names, affiliation & email ids (c) Abstract (d) Introduction (e) PoC architecture (f) PoC implementation details (g) hyperlink to the aforementioned youtube video and (h) references
Note 2:  The video can be captured using a mobile phone camera. We don’t expect professional quality video as long as we can clearly see the features of the working PoC

•A 6-slide presentation that details the strategy you adopted to realize your PoC 

5.Present your idea before a panel of judges at a session of the conference.

Please submit your tutorial proposal summary by 23rd September 2018 via Easychair for CCEM 2018
