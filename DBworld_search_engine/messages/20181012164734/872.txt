***** Publication *****
ALL accepted iiWAS2018 papers will be published by ACM International Conference Proceedings Series and the supplemental proceedings (ISBN: 978-1-4503-6479-9) which will be archived in the ACM Digital Library, and indexed by DBLP, Ei Compendex, Scopus and submitted to be reviewed by Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index (ISI Web of Science). Selected high-quality papers will be invited to be published, after revision and extension, in special issues of international journals. 

**** Scope *****
WWW has been driving global information integration. In spite of the many applications in all domains of our societies: e-business, e-commerce, e-learning, e-science, and e-government, for instance, as well as the tremendous advances by engineers and scientists, the seamless integration of information and services remains a major challenge. The current shared vision for the future is one of semantically rich information and service oriented architectures for global information systems. This vision is at the convergence of progress in technologies such as XML, Web services, RDF, OWL, of multimedia, multimodal, and multilingual information retrieval, and of distributed, mobile and ubiquitous computing. iiWAS2018 is the 20th in the series of the highly successful International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Systems. 
Recently, iiWAS has been held in Salzburg (2017), Singapore (2016), Brussels (2015), Hanoi (2014), Vienna (2013), Bali (2012), Ho Chi Minh City (2011), Paris (2010), Kuala Lumpur (2009), and Linz (2008). This year, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, the city of culture, arts and crafts where iiWAS was first conceived 20 years ago, will host iiWAS2018. The iiWAS conference series have provided opportunities to researchers, graduate students, and industry practitioners to address recent research results and current industry practices in the area of information integration and web-based applications.

We invite two types of submissions: Full Technical Papers and Short Position Papers.
- A Full Paper should provide solid conceptual and theoretical foundation and substantial support for its results and conclusions as a significant contribution to the field. 
- A Position Paper could be demo or Âœwork in progress, i.e., it reports the latest emerged ideas, approaches, methodologies, systems and application scenarios but have not yet been fully implemented and/or undergone extensive evaluation.
