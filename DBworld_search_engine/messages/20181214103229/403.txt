 *******************************************************************

Nowadays, humanity generates many large and complex datasets, especially, those based on data collected from social media or volunteered geographic information that have strong spatial and temporal characteristics. The generated data tend to be complex, heterogeneous (texts, images, videos, etc.), huge and rapidly growing or changing over space and time dimensions. Hence, special, dedicated solutions for visualizing the data and developing effective user interfaces that would assist users in efficient analysis need to be proposed and used. Effective data pre-processing and management techniques are also needed for constructing large-scale real-world applications or for investigating complex interaction patterns with such data in order to detect useful knowledge. 
This workshop, on User Interfaces for Spatial and Temporal Data Analysis (UISTDA2019) â€“ to be held in conjunction with the IUI2019 conference â€“ aims at sharing the latest progress and developments, current challenges and potential applications for exploring and exploiting large amounts of spatial and/or temporal data.

++ List of Topics ++
The main topics of the workshop are that of supporting user interface research through the practical application of Computer Science theories or technologies for analyzing and making use of spatial-temporal data, visualizing spatial-temporal data, and providing efficient access to the large wealth of spatial-temporal knowledge, especially from social media. In addition, the topics we are also interested in, include information retrieval, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, image processing, ubiquitous computing, and others for constructing effective systems to enable spatial-temporal data analysis and building real-world applications.
The topics of this workshop are as follows (but are not limited to):

- User interfaces for spatial-temporal data analysis
- Intelligent visualization tools for spatial-temporal data
- Applications with spatial-temporal data, e.g. route navigation and urban computing
- Evaluations of user interfaces or applications
- Spatial-temporal data mining and knowledge discovery
- Artificial intelligence applied to spatial-temporal data
- Natural language processing and text analytics applied to spatial-temporal data
- Information retrieval and extraction
- Image processing for spatial-temporal data
- Geographic information systems
- Social media analysis

++ Important Dates ++
- Paper Submission: December 3, 2018 (23:59 UTC-12)
- Acceptance Notification: January 14, 2019 (UTC-12)
- Camera-ready Submission : February 8, 2019 (23:59 UTC-12)
- Workshop date: March 20, 2019

++ Submission Guidelines ++
We invite two kinds of submissions:
- Full papers (max 8 pages*)
- Short papers (max 4 pages*)
* page count is excluding references 

Submissions should follow the standard SIGCHI format. Use either the Microsoft Word template or the LaTeX template. All submissions will undergo a peer-review process to ensure a high standard of quality. Referees will consider originality, significance, technical soundness, clarity of exposition, and relevance to the workshopâ€™s topics. The reviewing process will be double-blind so submissions should be properly anonymized and prepared according to the following guidelines:

- All submissions must be written in English.
- Authorâ€™s names and affiliations are not visible anywhere in the paper.
- Acknowledgements should be anonymized or removed during the review process.

Research papers should be submitted electronically as a single PDF through the EasyChair conference submission system: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=uistda2019.
