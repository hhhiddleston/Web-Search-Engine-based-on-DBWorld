Lightning Talks:
Lightning talks are fast-paced and high-energy. These are back-to-back 5-minute presentations -- using multimedia, slides, or movies -- on just about anything. Talk about a recent success, energize people about a pressing issue, ask a question, start a conversation!

Lightning talks are an opportunity to get up and talk about whatâ€™s on your mind.
Â Â Â Â 
You can give several lightning talks if you have more than one topic.
Â Â Â 
Posters:
Posters are a way for DYNAMICS attendees to present early results, gain feedback from conference and workshop attendees, and spark discussion among conference and workshop participants. The intent is for these posters is similar to lightning talks in that they provide a venue in support of new ideas and newcomers to our community.
