Call for Papers of IEEE BigDataService 2019
The Fifth IEEE International Conference on Big Data Service and Applications
April 4 - 9, 2019, San Francisco, USA
http://big-dataservice.net/

Big-Data computing and services have received significant attention in recent years. The IEEE BigDataService 2019 aims to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange innovative ideas, latest research results, and practical experiences and lessons learned. Its major objectives include big-data applications in various domains such as healthcare, business and financing, education and learning, social networks and media, urban and environment, sensors and Internet of things as well as technology aspects of big data computing and services such as computing services and architecture, modeling, data mining and analytics. The conference will be co-located with IEEE SOSE 2019, IEEE MobileCloud 2019 and IEEE DAPPCON 2019. IEEE BigDataService 2019 will consist of main tracks and special tracks. The conference will include 3 International Workshops of Smart City Big Data Analysis, Big Data in Water Resources, Environment, and Hydraulic from Engineering, and Industry Big Data and Signal Processing. All accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings which is published by the IEEE CPS. Selected papers will be invited for extension and published in journals (SCI-Index).
