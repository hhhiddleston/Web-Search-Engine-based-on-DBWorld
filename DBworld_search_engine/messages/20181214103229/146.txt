The 32nd International Conference on Industrial, Engineering & Other Applications of Applied Intelligent Systems} will continue the tradition of emphasizing on applications of applied intelligent systems to solve real-life problems in all areas. These areas include engineering, science, industry, automation & robotics, business & finance, medicine and biomedicine, bioinformatics, cyberspace, and human-machine interactions. IEA/AIE 2019 will have a special focus on automated driving and autonomous systems such that contributions dealing with such systems or their verification and validation are especially welcome. Topics of interest for submissions include, but are not limited to:

Adaptive Control                Evolutionary Computation        Non-Monotonic Logics 
Ambient Intelligence            Expert Systems                  Ontologies

Submission: Authors are invited to submit their papers written in English, and using up to 12 single column pages (including references) to present the results of original research or innovative applications.  Experience reports concerning  state-of-the-art AI methodologies which offer a unique value to the conference attendees are also welcome. Presentations of work in progress or suggesting possible research directions may be submitted as short papers with up to 6 pages. All contributions must conform to the Springer LNCS/LNAI style, and have to be submitted electronically via EasyChair. Papers submitted to IEA/AIE 2019 must not have been published or accepted for publication, or be under review for a journal or another conference. All submissions will be assessed in terms of originality, significance, technical merit, and clarity of the presentation in a double blind review process. 

The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNCS/LNAI) series. Authors of accepted papers will be allocated time for an oral presentation at the conference, and/or will have the opportunity to present their work in a poster session. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to fully register and attend the conference in order to present the work. All authors agree to this requirement when submitting their paper for review. 

A Best Paper Award and a Best Student Paper Award will be selected by the Best Paper Award Selection Committee and will be presented at the conference. The winners of each award will also receive a Springer monetary prize of EUR 500 (per paper).
