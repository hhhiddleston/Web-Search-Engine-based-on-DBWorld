The Carnegie Mellon University Database Group has completed its Hardware 
Accelerated Database Lectures seminar series this semester. We hosted
speakers from the leading developers of DBMSs designed to exploit modern
computational hardware (GPUs, FPGAS). Each speaker presented implementation
details of their respective systems and examples of the technical challenges
that they faced when working with real-world customers.

The videos for all of the talks are now available on Youtube:
