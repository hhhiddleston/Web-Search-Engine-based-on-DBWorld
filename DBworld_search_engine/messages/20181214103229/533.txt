The 19th international ACSD conference will be organized by the Process and Data Science (PADS) group at RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany. The new PADS group was established in the context of Wil van der Aalstâ€™s Alexander von Humboldt Professorship. The conference will take place in the conference area of the Tivoli football stadium close to the city center of Aachen. The language of the conference is English, and the conference proceedings will be submitted for inclusion to IEEE Xplore.


CONFERENCE SCOPE:
The conference aims at cross-fertilizing both theoretical and applied research about formal approaches (in a broad sense) to designing computer systems that exhibit some kind of concurrent behavior. In particular, the following topics are of interest:
- Formal models of computation and concurrency for the above systems and problems, like data- flow models, communicating automata, Petri nets, process algebras, graph rewriting systems, state charts, MSCs, modal and temporal logics
- Compositional design principles like modular synthesis, distributed simulation and implementation, distributed control, adaptivity, supervisory control
- Algorithms and tools for concurrent systems, ranging from programming languages to algorithmic methods for system analysis and construction, including model checking, verification, and static analysis techniques as well as synthesis procedures
- Synchronous and asynchronous systems on all design levels: polychronous systems, endochronous systems, globally asynchronous locally synchronous systems
- Cyber-physical systems, hybrid systems, networked systems, and networks in biological systems
- High-performance computer architectures like many-core processors, networks on chip, graphics processing units, instruction-level parallelism, dataflow architectures, up to ad-hoc, mobile, and wireless networks
- Memory consistency models for multiprocessor and multicore architectures, replicated data, including software and hardware memory models, DRAM scheduling, cache coherency, memory-aware algorithms
- Real-time aspects, including hard real-time requirements, security and safety-critical issues, functional and timing verification
- Implementation aspects like resource management, including task and communication scheduling, network-, memory-, and power-management, energy/power distribution, fault-tolerance, quality of service, scalability, load balancing, power proportionality
- Design principles for concurrent systems, in particular hardware/software co-design, platform-based design, component-based design, energy-aware design, refinement techniques, hardware/software abstractions, cross-layer optimization
- Business process modelling, workflow execution systems, process (de-)composition, inter-organizational and heterogeneous workflow systems, systems for computer-supported collaborative work, web services
- Case studies of general interest, from industrial applications to consumer electronics and multimedia, automotive systems, (bio-)medical applications, neuromorphic applications, internet (of things) and grid computing, to gaming applications.


PAPER SUBMISSION:
ACSD seeks papers describing original work which has not been previously published and is not under review for publication elsewhere. All files must be prepared using the latest IEEE Computer Society conference proceedings guidelines (8.5â€ Ã— 11â€ two-column format). The page limit for regular papers is 10 pages. Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings. At least one author of each accepted contribution is expected to present the paper at the conference, and will be required to sign the copyright release forms. All papers have to be submitted via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acsd2019.

AACHEN
Aachen is a historic city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, at the point where Germany borders on Belgium and the Netherlands. Historically this spa-town was a prominent city, the place where the German Kings were crowned, and the residence of Charlemagne who still lies buried in the impressive cathedral he himself had built. The city has many historical sites that remind of those days, including medieval buildings, city gates, and beautiful fountains. Aachen is Germanyâ€™s westernmost city. It lies near the borders with Belgium and the Netherlands and is nestled between the large national parks of the Eifel and the Ardennes. The city has a population of 260,000, which includes about 50,000 students and more than 4,000 academic staff from across the world. Its lively student community lends the city just as much character as its history. Aachen is famous for its Printen gingerbread, its hot springs, its Mardi Gras carnival and one of the worldâ€™s largest equestrian tournaments. The historic city center and a wealth of bars, cafÃ©s, and restaurants, combined with the nearby nature parks, such as the Eifel, make Aachen a city where everyone feels at home. The venue of the conference, the Tivoli football stadium, is located on the border of the city center. This beautiful venue will provide a unique atmosphere with great views and excellent conference facilities.
