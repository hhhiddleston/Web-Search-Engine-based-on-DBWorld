*** FIRST CALL FOR DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM SUBMISSIONS *** 

27th ACM International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation
and Personalization (ACM UMAP 2019)

Golden Bay Beach Hotel 5*, Larnaca, Cyprus, June 9-12, 2019

https://www.um.org/umap2019/


Submissions due:     March 1, 2019


ACM UMAP 2019, the premier international conference for researchers and
practitioners working on systems that adapt to individual users or to groups
of users, and which collect, represent, and model user information, will, as
in previous issues of the conference series, include a Doctoral Consortium
(DC) Session, which provides an opportunity for doctoral students to explore
and develop their research interests under the guidance of distinguished
researchers from the field. Doctoral students are invited to apply to present
their research to experienced scholars who will provide constructive
feedback and advice.

The Doctoral Consortium is implemented as a student mentoring program
that introduces students to senior researchers from the relevant fields.
Students are expected to document in a brief submission their doctoral
research (see below described submission information for further details),
which will be evaluated by the consortium committee.

Good quality applications will be selected for presentation at a Doctoral
Consortium Session as part of the conference. Promising, but less well-
developed applications will be selected for presentation at a poster session.
Each student with an accepted submission will be assigned a mentor who
will provide feedback on the student's work and will discuss the doctoral
research with the student and the audience at the consortium.


How to Submit to the Doctoral Consortium

To apply for the ACM UMAP 2019 Doctoral Consortium, students are asked
to submit a paper presenting their doctoral research that describes:
¥  The problem being addressed.
¥  Motivation outlining the relevance of the problem and referring to
related work.
¥  The main contributions that the PhD project aims to achieve.
¥  The progress made to date (including a clear description of the
proposed approach, methodology and preliminary results) as well as the
plan for further research.
¥  Topics include (but are not limited to) the ACM UMAP 2019 key areas.

Each DC submission is encouraged to consider the following: identification
of related (state of the art) work, indication of the potential innovation,
application or advancement of the state-of-the-art that the work intends to
achieve. In addition, as appropriate for the PhD project, the submissions can
consider: indication of data to be used for experimentation, indication of
implementation approach, indication of evaluation criteria and experimental
design.

Each submission should contain a cover page including the paper title, name
of the PhD candidate, the name of his/her supervisor(s) and University, a
paragraph describing the stage they are in the PhD programme, together
with a brief description of their background. This will enable the committee
to adapt its assistance to each student.

Papers should be submitted via the EasyChair Doctoral Consortium
submission system:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acmumap2019dc

Submissions should be pdf documents consisting of 1 cover page and the
paper (up to 4 pages long), formatted using the ACM SIG proceedings
template.


ACM UMAP Proceedings

The accepted ACM UMAP 2019 Doctoral Consortium papers will be included
in the Conference Proceedings, which will be published by ACM and that will
be available via the ACM Digital Library. The main author (doctoral student)
must register for the conference for the paper to be included in the
proceedings.


Financial Support

ACM UMAP has a history of supporting students to attend. Further details
will be announced on the website soon.
