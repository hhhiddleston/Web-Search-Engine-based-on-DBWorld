Third International Workshop on Semantic Data Integration (SDI 2019)
(in conjunction with the 13th IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing)

CALL FOR PAPERS

There has been an exponential growth and availability of data, both structured and unstructured. Massive amounts of data are available to be harvested for competitive business advantage, government policies, and new insights into a broad array of applications (including healthcare, biomedicine, energy, smart cities, genomics, transportation, etc.). Yet, most of this data is inaccessible to users, as we need technology and tools to find, transform, analyze, and visualize data in order to make it consumable for decision-making. Meaningful data integration in a schema-less, and complex Big Data world of databases on the web is a big open challenge. Semantic computing is being used in the area of data integration. The Linked Open Data (LOD) community effort is an initiative that has led to a huge data space in the form of triples. Linked data is the method of connecting and publishing related structured data on the web. LOD can be used in a number of interesting and useful Web and mobile applications. The focus of this workshop is on recent advances in Semantic computing approaches for data integration and quality.

Topics of Interest:

The topics of interest within context of this workshop include Semantic computing approaches for data extraction, integration, cleaning, and quality, but are not limited to:
* Schema-based data integration
* Schema matching
* Traditional Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) frameworks
* Ontology-based integration systems
* Graph-based algorithms for data integration
* Real-time integration
* Schema-less approaches such as NoSQL for data integration
* Data quality challenges such as cleaning, record linkage, de-duplication, provenance, and auditing.
* Application-specific integration and data quality

Important Dates:

â€‹November 30, 2018  Submission deadline (Extended)
December 15, 2018  Notification of acceptance
December 22, 2018  Camera-Ready Submission

Submission:

â€‹Authors are invited to submit a paper up to 6 pages (in English) in double-column IEEE format following the submission guidelines available at the ICSC 2019 web page.  Papers must be original and not be submitted to or accepted by any other conference or journal. An electronic version (PDF format) of the full paper should be submitted by the deadline. All papers should be submitted through Easychair (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sdi2019).
 
Each paper will be peer-reviewed by at least two experts in the topical area. Papers accepted by the workshop will be published in the conference proceedings published by IEEE Computer Society Press.
