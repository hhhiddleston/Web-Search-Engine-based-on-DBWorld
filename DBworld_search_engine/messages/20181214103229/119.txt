We are happy to announce the 6th Swiss Conference on Data Science (SDS2019) in continuation of what has successfully started with the past events.

SDS2019 brings together opinion-leaders, practitioners, decision-makers and researchers with interest in Data Science. The goal is to foster the exchange of ideas for innovative products and services especially for the Swiss market and to sustain the community of Data Scientists.

SDS2019 will have talks in 2 distinct streams of academic and business contributions. The accepted academic paper proceedings will be published in IEEE Xplore digital library. For businesses, talks having business impact and data-driven innovation concepts are invited and will be presented.

Get access to trends, innovations, and technologies that you can directly use for the development of your products, solutions, and applications based on data, and use the breaks for networking and discussion with peers.
