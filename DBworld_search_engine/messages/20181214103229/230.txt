The Alberto Mendelzon International Workshop on Foundation of Data Management (AMW) brings together top researchers from all over the world, creating the opportunity to discuss and spread research results relating to data management (in sub-areas including, but not limited to, databases, web, knowledge representation, data mining, information retrieval). AMW is a way to honour the memory of Alberto Mendelzon and places emphasis on promoting research ties with Latin America in these areas.

The co-located AMW Summer School provides an opportunity for students (graduate and undergraduate), researchers, and practitioners, to attend tutorials from internationally-renowned speakers and to interact with the research community. Students from Latin America are particularly encouraged to attend (please check homepage for news of travel grants).

AMW 2019 will take place in AsunciÃ³n, Paraguay, from June 3-7, 2019.

(We kindly ask you to consider distributing this Call for Papers to others who may be interested.)

Papers addressing foundational aspects are particularly welcome. However, we also encourage the submission of papers (especially short papers; see submission instructions below) that illustrate applications of foundational results in real-world contexts.

== SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS ==

We invite two types of submissions:

(a) Extended abstracts of up to 10 pages, presenting original research.
(b) Short papers of up to 4 pages that may contain either original ongoing research or recently published results.

Both extended abstracts and short papers will be published in the CEUR Workshop proceedings (http://ceur-ws.org). Authors can opt-out if desired.

Papers should be written in English and have to be formatted according to the LNCS Springer style for Lecture Notes in Computer Science and submitted electronically via EasyChair (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=amw2019) in PDF format. The submissions will be judged by the Program Committee for scientific quality and relevance. At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop to present the work.
