********  EDBT 2019 - Call for Demonstration Proposals ********  

The International Conference on Extending Database Technology is a leading international 
forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to discuss cutting-edge 
ideas, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences related to data management.

The EDBT demonstration program has become an important venue for sharing cutting-edge, 
prototype data management systems with the greater EDBT community. 
We solicit demonstration proposals that will showcase the most exciting new data management 
technologies.

We welcome demo papers on topics including, but not limited to:

Availability, reliability, and scalability
Big data storage, processing and transformation
Complex event processing and data streams
Concurrency control, recovery, and transaction management
Data management in clouds
Data mining and knowledge discovery
Data quality, curation, and provenance
Data warehousing, large-scale analytics and ETL tools
Emerging hardware and in-memory databases
Experiments and analysis
Graph databases and semantic web
Heterogeneous databases, data integration
Machine learning systems
Middleware and workflow management
Parallel, distributed and grid data management
Privacy, trust and security in databases
Query processing and optimization
Scientific and statistical databases
Semi-structured and linked data management
Sensor and mobile data management
Social networks and crowdsourcing
Spatial, temporal, and geographic databases
Text databases and information retrieval
Tuning, monitoring, benchmarking and performance evaluation User interfaces and data visualization

Demonstrations may consist of software, hardware, or both. The emphasis of the EDBT demonstration 
program is on visionary, next generation systems requiring significant research and development effort.

Authors may include a description of the novel intellectual content of the underlying system and 
of its architecture. The demonstration proposal must include citations of the most relevant papers 
about the proposed system and any previous publications of that same system.

Submission Guidelines
**************** 

All submissions will be electronic via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=edbt19

Length: Demo papers (including bibliographic references) should not exceed 4 pages.

File type: Each demo proposal is to be submitted as a single PDF file, formatted for A4 paper and 
no more than 5 MB in file size.  

Formatting: Demo papers must be must follow the ACM Proceedings Format. Please make sure you are 
using the latest version. Modified ACM LaTeX2e style files with ISBN and copyright information for 
EDBT 2019 can be downloaded here: http://edbticdt2019.inesc-id.pt/?call_for_demos. Any submitted 
paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be rejected without review.

Conflicts of interest (COI):

When submitting a demo paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of 
interest of the paperâ€™s authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility 
of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their PC members they have a COI with as defined 
below. Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information at the time when submission closes are 
rejected.

A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when, and only when, one or more of 
the following conditions holds:

The PC member is a co-author of the paper.
The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past two years.
The PC member has been a collaborator within the past two years.
The PC member is or was the author's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.
The author is or was the PC member's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.
The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author.
Evaluation Criteria
Selection of demonstrations for presentation at EDBT is highly competitive. The evaluation criteria 
include both the audience experience and the novelty of the system. The proposal should also describe 
in detail what EDBT attendees who view the demonstration will experience. What exactly will the 
audience see? Will they be able to interact with the system? Is there an interesting scenario or 
script that the demonstrators will use to motivate the demonstration?
