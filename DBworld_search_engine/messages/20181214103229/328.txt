You are passionate about building robust systems and want to make a difference. You are interested in query processing, distributed systems and compilers, and certainly don't want to waste your talent on re-inventing things that have already been done before. You are looking to work in a fast-paced environment where what you do has impact - both on the company, but also on the industry.

Join Datometry, a young and dynamic startup in the heart of San Francisco. We are pioneering Adaptive Database Virtualization, a next-generation virtualization technology that redefines database technology as we know it. We are working with multiple Fortune 500 companies as well as global technology partners to accomplish what was generally thought impossible before. Our technology lets enterprises adopt cloud-native data management systems rapidly and risk-free by enabling existing applications to run natively on those cloud-native databases.

At Datometry you will be working with an exceptionally strong team of recognized database researchers and industry experts. We are proud of a team culture that relies on self-starters and creative initiative taken by each and every one, a culture that is inclusive and draws on the strengths of each individual. Publishing and presenting our work at leading database conferences is the natural extension of our development of innovative software products.

Required Qualifications:

- MSc or PhD in Computer Science or related field
- Experience in building systems and systems software development
- Expertise in one or more of the following areas: query optimization, database systems, distributed systems, programming languages, or compilers
