33rd ECMS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION
(Data Stream Analytics Track)
Caserta, Area of Napoli, Italy

This track’s area of interest is on the “velocity” dimension of Big Data. The analytics of high velocity data has many applications, such as large-scale simulation, health monitoring, topic detection in Twitter, transportation control, network intrusion detection, etc. Streaming data may change its characteristics over time resulting in what is known as “concept drift”. This track covers both papers on the methodology of data stream analytics but also applications enabled by data stream mining techniques.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
---

- Data stream mining algorithms, models and techniques

- Real-time data stream analytics applications

- Real-time analytics of simulation data
