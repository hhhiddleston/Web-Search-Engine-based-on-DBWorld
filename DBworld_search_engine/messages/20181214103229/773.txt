Dr. Da Yan from the University of Alabama at Birmingham is looking for a PhD student experienced at hands-on machine learning (esp. deep learning). This is a fully-funded RA position.

The applicant is supposed to be familiar with Python and libraries like NumPy, TensorFlow (and preferrably others like pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK), and has gone through Stanford's CS231n online class (including all assignments). Good knowledge about machine learning and data mining is also expected, and undergraduate GPA of 3.5/4.0 or higher and good English presentation skills are preferred.

If you are interested (and eligible), please send your transcripts (must include the undergraduate one), CV, and a best publication sample if any to yanda@uab.edu for making a Skype interview appointment.
