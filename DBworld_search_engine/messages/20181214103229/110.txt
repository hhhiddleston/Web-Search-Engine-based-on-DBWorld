Northwestern University continues our ambitious initiative to grow and transform Computer Science (CS). We are in the midst of adding twenty new tenure-track facultyâ€”ten in core Computer Science, and ten collaboratively with other disciplines (CS+X)â€”as well as a number of non-tenure track teaching faculty. We seek outstanding candidates with a clear passion to make a difference in Computer Science and who are excited by the opportunity to help build the future of CS at a great University.

We invite candidates to apply for multiple new positions as Professor of Computer Science at all levels. A key focus this year is in databases, but are interested in applications from outstanding faculty in all areas of Computer Science. We also encourage applicants to CS+X faculty positions jointly with other schools or departments at Northwestern, for individuals and teams exploring new research boundaries in computation. In the last few years, we have hired jointly with Statistics, Learning Sciences, and Journalism, and we remain committed to interdisciplinary research leveraging Northwesternâ€™s unique strengths in many areas. Priority in all areas will be given to applicants with path-breaking research interests that have the potential to transform both Computer Science and other disciplines.

Northwestern is a world-leading research and teaching university with an unrivaled combination of excellent schools that provide extraordinary opportunities for collaboration across a wide range of disciplines. Located just outside of Chicago â€“ a diverse and culturally vibrant world-class city â€“ Northwestern faculty have ample opportunities to connect with the cityâ€™s growing technology sector.

We encourage candidates to send applications as soon as possible. Applications received by December 15, 2018 will be given full consideration. However, the positions will remain open until filled. Applicants should submit (1) a cover letter indicating rank applied for, (2) a curriculum vitae, (3) three to five references, (4) statements of research and teaching interests, and (5) two representative publications.
