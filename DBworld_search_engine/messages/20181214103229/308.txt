The MDM series of conferences, since its debut in 1999, has established itself as 

a prestigious forum for the exchange of innovative and significant research results 

in mobile data management. The conference provides unique opportunities to bring 

researchers, engineers, and practitioners together to explore new ideas, techniques, 

and tools, and exchange experiences. 



Continuing its history, MDM 2019 seeks submissions of original research contributions 

in the intersection of mobile computing and data management. Topics of interest 

include, but not limited to: 



- Mobile Cloud Computing and Data Management in the Mobile Cloud 

- Data Management for Internet of Things (IoT) and Sensor Systems 

- Data Management for Augmented Reality Systems 

- Connected Cars, Intelligent Transportation Systems, Smart Spaces 

- Mobile Crowd-Sourcing and Crowd-Sensing 

- Mobile Data Analytics 

- Behavioural/Activity Sensing and Analytics 

- Mobile Location-Based Social Networks 

- Mobile Recommendation Systems 

- Context-aware Computing for Intelligent Mobile Services 

- Middleware and Tools for Mobile and Pervasive Computing 

- Theoretical Foundations of Data-intensive Mobile Computing 

- Data Stream Processing in Mobile/Sensor Network 

- Indexing, Optimisation and Query Processing for Moving Objects/Users 

- Location and Trajectory Analytics 

- Security and Privacy in Mobile Systems 

- Routing, Personalized Routing, Eco-Routing, Routing for Electrical Vehicles 

- Transportation-As-A-Service, Mobility-As-A-Service 

- Innovative Applications driven by Mobile Data 



Besides the main research track, two special tracks are dedicated to submissions that 

promote research and applications in the interdisciplinary areas: (i) Mobile Data & AI

and (ii) Transport & Urban Analytics.



Along with the research track papers, we invite industrial papers as well as 

submissions for demos, panels, PhD forum, and workshops. 

- Workshops are for fast track publications of work-in-progress papers 

- Demos will present state of the art systems and prototypes 

- Panels will review current research activities and explore new frontiers 
- Advanced seminars will present in-depth surveys of selected topics 

- PhD forum is to encourage doctoral student participation 

- Industrial forum for companies to present their research and development 

  technologies/systems
