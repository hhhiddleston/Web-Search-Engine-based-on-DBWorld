A position of associate professor in distributed systems is available with the research 
section of Networks and Distributed Systems at the University of Oslo.

The section is seeking a scientist with clear research visions, educational and 
administrative skills and abilities to establish and lead research projects.


*** The closing date for applications is November 1st, 2018. ***

How to apply is described in

https://www.jobbnorge.no/en/available-jobs/job/157032/associate-professor-in-distributed-systems


HOST INSTITUTION AND ENVIRONMENT

The University of Oslo is Norway's largest and oldest institution of higher 
education. Founded in 1811, today the University of Oslo has approx. 30,000 
students and 4,600 employees. Four Nobel Prize winners and two Turing
award recipients indicate the quality of the research at the University in 
general and at the Department of Informatics in particular.

Norway has ben consistently ranked by the UN as having the highest
standard of living in the world. It is also known for its unique scenic beauty.
The work is in a smart futuristic building that has won multiple awards.

The research section of Networks and Distributed systems (ND) has nine full- and 
part-time faculty members. It encompasses research activities in most layers of 
distributed systems and networking, and has tight collaboration and synergy in 
the areas of information security and energy informatics. Within distributed 
systems, the ND section has been considering fundamental middleware techniques 
of self-adaptation, dependability, scalability, and data dissemination, with 
the objective of enhancing user experience and quality of services. The ND 
section has been applying these techniques to a large spectrum of application 
domains, such as blockchain technologies, IoT and sensornets, cloud and fog 
computing, cyberphysical systems, multimedia systems, publish/subscribe, 
dark Internet, distributed machine learning, social networks, and others. 

For example, we are considering software-defined infrastructures for big IoT 
data capable of both offline analysis and online control of massive scale data 
systems such as smart cities. In the blockchain domain, we are investigating 
both open and consortium blockchains, motivated by the application domains of 
sharing of medical data, energy markets, document storage, supply chains, and 
others. In the context of distributed machine learning, we are interested in 
scaling deep neural networks through parallelization and application of 
distributed algorithms.

SUITABLE BACKGROUND AND REQUIREMENTS

The candidate must have achieved associate professor level in informatics and 
have formal qualifications within the general area of distributed systems. At 
otherwise equal qualifications preference will be given to candidates with 
research applicable to energy informatics. While candidates at various levels 
of expertise within the range field of distributed systems will be considered, 
priority will be given to candidates with up to 10 years of experience after 
completion of PhD, who already have a scientific track record showing great 
promise, with an emphasis on the last five years.

The applicant should describe how his/her research and teaching is related to 
the current activity in the Networked and Distributed Systems section and at 
the department and how it may extend and complement it.

Many computer science projects at the department use combinations of simulations, 
experiments, development of prototypes and empirical analysis. While a wide span 
of research methods including complementary theoretical research is considered an 
advantage, the candidate is expected to have expertise in system building and 
empirical analysis in order to contribute to such projects.

The University of Oslo is a multi-lingual environment, where prior knowledge of 
Norwegian is not a prerequisite. However, the appointee is expected within two 
years to learn enough Norwegian to be able to participate actively in all functions 
the position may involve. Fluency in both written and spoken English is a prerequisite.
