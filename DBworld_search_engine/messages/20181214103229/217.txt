The IFIP Networking 2019 Conference (NETWORKING 2019), to be held in Warsaw, Poland, is the 18th event of the series, sponsored by the IFIP Technical Committee on Communication Systems (TC6). Accepted papers will be published in the IFIP Digital Library and submitted to the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.

TOPIC AREAS OF IFIP NETWORKING 2019
The main objective of Networking 2019 is to bring together members of the networking community, from both academia and industry, to discuss recent advances in the broad and quickly-evolving fields of computer and communication networks, to highlight key issues, identify trends, and develop a vision for future Internet technology, operation, and use.

The technical sessions will be structured around (but not limited to) the following areas:

Network Architectures, Applications and Services
Software-defined networking, network (functions) virtualization, datacenter networking, cloud/fog computing, information-centric networking, content distribution, tactile internet, cyber-physical systems, Internet-of-Things, optical networks, web architectures and protocols, overlay and P2P networks, evolution of IP network architectures and protocols, green networking, resilient networks, network management, traffic engineering, Quality-of-Service, emerging value-added services and applications.

Network Modeling and Analysis
Topology characterization, performance measurements, traffic monitoring and analysis, use behavior modeling, Quality-of-Experience, data-driven design, user profiling and tracking, complex and dynamic networks, analysis of participatory networks, social networks, socio-economic aspects of networks, pricing and billing.

Network Security and Privacy
Network security protocols, trust and privacy, anomaly and malware detection, denial-of-service detection and mitigation, network forensics, authentication, applications of privacy-preserving computation in networks, anonymization, dependability, situational awareness, threat intelligence, blockchains and their applications.

Wireless Networking
5G access networks, long-range communication, ad-hoc and mesh networks, mobile networks, self-organizing networks, wireless sensor networks, visible light communication, localization, delay/disruption tolerant networks, opportunistic networks, wireless power transfer networks, device-to-device communication, vehicular networks.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through single-blind peer review. Only original papers that have not been published or submitted for review elsewhere will be considered.

Submitted papers should be written in the English language, with a maximum length limit of 9 printed pages (IEEE two-column format, 10 pt), including all the figures, references, and appendices. Papers longer than 9 pages will not be reviewed. 

All papers must be submitted in the Portable Document Format (PDF) electronically using EDAS (https://edas.info/N25189). When submitting the paper, the title, all co-authors, and a concise abstract of up to 200 words should be provided to EDAS as the metadata of the paper. The metadata should be provided before the abstract registration deadline.

An author of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the full (member or non-member) rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC co-chairs grant permission for a substitute presenter before the conference. 
Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final correctly formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IFIP Digital Library and submitted to IEEE Xplore.

To ensure appropriate consideration of conflicts of interest during the review process, changes to the list of authors are prohibited once a paper has been submitted for review.
Should a paper be accepted, the complete list of authors, including the ordering of authors, must remain identical as the EDAS metadata in the final camera-ready manuscript.
