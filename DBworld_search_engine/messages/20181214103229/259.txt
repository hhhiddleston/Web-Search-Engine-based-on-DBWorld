IEEE INFOCOM 2019 - 2nd Workshop on on Cryptocurrencies and Blockchains for Distributed Systems (CryBlock 2019)
http://www.cryblock.org

April 29, 2019 - Paris, France 

*** Submission deadline: December 30, 2018 ***

*Workshop Description*

The Internet is evolving into a new multi-factor paradigm based around smart systems, Internet of Things, new distributed data structures (e.g. blockchains) and digital assets (e.g. cryptocurrencies). In the next years, these technologies will converge and interact, fostering novel services, business models and applications. Indeed, the blockchain can provide an automated and secure transaction infrastructure for next generation Internet of Things (IoT), mobile and smart systems while the voluntary user participation to the mining of cryptocurrencies could permit the development of new distributed services (i.e. offering an alternative to the advertisement-based revenue system used by most of the â€œfree servicesâ€ that are currently available). This workshop aims at gathering together researchers and practitioners, coming from academia and industry, to focus on the new challenges posed by the novel technologies and applications that are based on the blockchains infrastructure. The goal is to promote discussion on theory, progresses, development, deployment and on the practical usage of cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, smart contracts, etc. We are interested both in innovative works in an unexplored and/or emerging topic in the broad area of distributed systems (e.g., mobile systems, devices and applications, vehicular and robotic systems, IoT), and in novel findings and/or new insights that build on existing works. The submission of both â€œfull-fledgedâ€ technical papers and â€œvisionaryâ€ position papers is strongly encouraged. Demos, tutorial and hands-on on submission are most welcome.

The specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:  

All kind of blockchain based distributed systems
Distributed (smart) systems relying on cryptocurrencies and smart contracts
Blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT)
Blockchain and mobile systems
Blockchain based mobile ad-hoc networks
Blockchain based intelligent vehicular coordination
Vehicular services based on cryptocurrencies and blockchain
