Continuing a long tradition, ER 2019 will host a number of workshops to be held in conjunction with the main ER 2019 conference. The workshops will serve as an intensive collaborative forum for exchanging innovative ideas about conceptual modeling, and for discovering new frontiers for its use. We specifically invite proposals for interactive workshops on new, emerging, or established topics in conceptual modeling, or its application in specific domains. We encourage workshop organizers to include activities that provide their participants with a true workshop experience. Topics of interest include foundations of conceptual models, theories of concepts, ontology-driven conceptual modeling and analysis, methods and tools for developing, communicating, consolidating, and evolving conceptual models, and techniques for transforming conceptual models into effective implementations.
