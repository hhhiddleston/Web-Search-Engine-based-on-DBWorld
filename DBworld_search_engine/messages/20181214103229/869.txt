We solicit nominations for the ICDT 2019 Test of Time Award for the ICDT 2009 paper that has had the most impact in terms of research, methodology, conceptual contribution, or transfer to practice.

The ICDT 2019 ToT Award Committee consists of Wenfei Fan (chair), Ke Yi, and Magdalena Ortiz. 

All papers are nominated by default, but the committee welcomes input from our community.
Please feel free to nominate a paper if you think it has had great impact, even if you have not thoroughly compared it to the other eligible papers.
The usual conflict of interest rules apply. 
Nominations are confidential and will only be shared among the committee members. 

Please email your nominations to Wenfei Fan (wenfei@inf.ed.ac.uk), CC'ing Ke Yi (yike@cse.ust.hk) and Magdalena Ortiz (ortiz@kr.tuwien.ac.at), with subject line "ICDT ToT Award Suggestion", together with a brief justification. Please send your nominations no later than October 20th, 2018.

The ICDT ToT award for 2019 will be presented during the EDBT/ICDT 2019 Joint Conference in March 26-29, 2019 in Lisbon, Portugal.
