The Digital Government Society (DGS) will hold the 20th Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research – dg.o 2019, 
with a theme “Governance in the Age of Artificial Intelligence“.  dg.o 2019 will be hosted by the Mohammed Bin Rashid School of Government 
(formerly the Dubai School of Government), Dubai, United Arab Emirates on 18-20 June, 2019.  
The dg.o conferences are an established forum for presentation, discussion, and demonstration of interdisciplinary research on digital government, 
political participation, civic engagement, technology innovation, applications, and practice. Each year the conference brings together scholars 
recognized for the interdisciplinary and innovative nature of their work, their contributions to theory (rigor) and practice (relevance), their focus 
on important and timely topics and the quality of their writing.

The 20th Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research will feature the main theme of “Governance in the Age of Artificial Intelligence“. The growing applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are triggering numerous opportunities—as well as challenges and dilemmas—for governments worldwide. Traditional forms of service provisioning, policy-making and enforcement are changing due to the inclusion AI algorithms, mechanisms and techniques. The growing digitization of government operations, the universal datafication of societal activities, behaviors and sentiments, as well as the maturity and feasibility of big data techniques and applications have collectively laid down solid foundations for industrial-scale operationalization of AI across most governments and societal sectors. This year’s timely theme, builds on the dg.o 2018 conference which focused on governance in the data age. The rapid growth of the data-driven economy and the use of intelligent mechanisms result in rapid digitalization of government operations and the emergence of new governance structures. This datafication and AI revolution is boosted by growing smart cities applications, Internet of Things (IoT), social media, mobile apps, among other sources of big data.
