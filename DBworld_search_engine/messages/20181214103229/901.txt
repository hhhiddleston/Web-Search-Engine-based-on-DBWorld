At the Technical Faculty of IT and Design, Department of Computer Science, Center for Data-Intensive Systems (Daisy), one or more PhD stipends in Data Management for Indoor LBS are available within the general study programme Computer Science and Engineering. The stipends are open for appointment from 1 January 2019 or soon thereafter.

JOB DESCRIPTION
Indoor LBS is currently of great interest and usefulness as people spend about 87% of their lives indoors. Nevertheless, indoor LBS has yet to be widely available in practice. A fundamental reason for the gap is that indoor data management is still in its infancy. The positions are made available by the research project Data Management for Indoor LBS funded by Independent Research Fund Denmark. The overall objective of this project is to establish general data management foundations and design novel data related technologies/prototypes for indoor LBS applications.

A recruited PhD student is expected to conduct research on one of the following topics:
- Data modeling for indoor LBS
- Queries for indoor LBS
- Refinement and analytics of indoor location uncertainty

General requirements for the PhD positions:
* A master degree in computer science or a closely related field
* Strong programming skill
* Good communication skill and team spirit

A project description (research proposal) of max 2 pages excl. references must be attached to the application. The description should outline a relevant research project.

APPLICATION DEADLINE
11 October, 2018
