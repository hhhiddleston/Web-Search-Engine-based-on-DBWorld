Tweet stream analysis for event detection and tracking

The IDENUM project aims to follow events on twitter. It is a transdisciplinary regional project among computer science, information and communication science and industrial partners. 
The scientific objectives of the postoc is to create and develop methods to dynamically follow an event by reformulating the set of keywords to collect on Twitter. The initial input is a set of keywords describing the event, eventually a pair of geographic coordinates precising a rectangular region. Multimodal stream clustering techniques, semantic resources, text, image, graph embedding methods are some of the covered domains.  
 The corpus is composed of tweets with their metadata and attached images. All this information is to be considered it the dynamic tracking of events.
We collaborate for this project with information and communication science who are interested in a more qualitative analysis of events on social network, focusing on visual and textual representation of the events.
