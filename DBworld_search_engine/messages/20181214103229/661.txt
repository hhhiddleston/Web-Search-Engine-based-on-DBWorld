=======================
9th International Conference on Web Intelligence, Mining and Semantics (WIMS 2019)
Seoul, Korea -- 26-28 June 2019

http://ke.cau.ac.kr/wims2019/

Deadline for submissions: 11 January 2019
 
WIMS is a series of peer-reviewed International Computer Science conferences. It is a forum for researchers and practitioners to present their state-of-the-art results in building Intelligent Web, to examine performance characteristics of various approaches in Web-based intelligent information technology, and to cross-fertilize their ideas on the development of Web-based intelligent information management solutions across different domains.

The purpose of the WIMS series is:

 - To provide a forum for established researchers and practitioners to present their contributions to the state of the art research and development in Web technology and applications.
 - To give doctoral students an opportunity to present their research to a friendly and knowledgeable audience and receive valuable feedback.
 - To provide an informal social event where Web technology researchers and practitioners can meet.

WIMS traditionally hosts a small number of short tutorials on the topics related to the scope of the conference series. The role of a WIMS tutorial is to be a theme-oriented comprehensive survey. WIMS also offers its infrastructure and facilities for the organizers of satellite workshops that complement the scope of the conference. The calls for WIMSâ€™19 Tutorials and Workshops are published separately.

WIMS solicits regular and work-in-progress research, discussion papers and industry experience report papers in related fields. Papers exploring new directions or areas are also welcome.

Submission Instructions
-----------------------
Four types of submissions are solicited for the main conference:
1. Regular research papers (12 ACM pages)
2. Short research papers (6 ACM pages)
3. Discussion, survey, or problem analysis papers (12 ACM pages)
4. Posters (4 ACM pages)

- Regular Research Papers: The papers in this category are the reports on the accomplished research work. They present a novel method, technique or analysis with appropriate empirical or other type of evaluation as a proof of validity. The main evaluation criteria for this category are originality, technical soundness, and the soundness of evaluation. Page Limit: 12 ACM pages.

- Short Research Papers: The papers in this category are the short reports of the preliminary results or describing the work in progress. The main evaluation criteria for this category are originality, technical correctness, and possible value of the planned results in a short to mid-term perspective. Short papers can be also presented in a form of a poster. Page Limit: 6 ACM pages.

- Discussion, Survey, or Problem Analysis Papers: The papers solicited in this category will not present any novel method, technique or approach to solving a problem, but help understand the problem itself. Within the genre, we expect receiving reasonable overviews placing a problem onto the state-of-the-art landscape and analyzing how far current solutions fall short. We also expect in-depth discussions and analysis of a certain problem, with clear definitions and argumentation in terms of qualitative or quantitative representation of the main characteristics of the problem. Page Limit: 12 ACM pages.

- Posters: WIMS poster track is a venue for late-breaking results, ongoing research activities, and speculative or innovative work in progress. This track is intended to provide authors and participants with the ability to connect with each other and to engage in discussions about the work. Posters provide authors with a unique opportunity to draw attention to their work during the conference. Page Limit: 4 ACM pages.

The papers in all the categories should describe original results that have not been accepted or submitted for publication elsewhere. All submissions will be evaluated by at least three members of the international program committee.

Submissions should be made electronically in PDF or DOC/DOCX (MS/Open Word) format via the electronic submission system of the WIMS 2019 Conference Management system at WIMS 2019 Easychair page.

The submissions should be typeset using the templates of the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). The templates could be retrieved from the ACM website.
