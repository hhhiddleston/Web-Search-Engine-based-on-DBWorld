SCOPE:
Information Technology is a fundamental enabler of today's service economy. There is also a growing recognition of the critical role of digital service innovation in improving productivity levels and quality of life. Further technological paradigms such as Web services, the Internet of Things, cloud  computing, social computing, and engagement platforms are redefining the landscape of service. This has brought increased policy and research focus to the conceptualisation, design, delivery, and evaluation of service systems.

The second part of Seventh Australasian Symposium on Service Research and Innovation will bring together a cross-disciplinary group of researchers and practitioners who are engaged in research and development in the area of service, broadly defined. It will feature keynote addresses and invited lectures by prominent researchers in  the field. There will also be paper sessions to which researchers are invited to submit their recent work. A public sector and industry forum featuring some of the academic researchers and practitioners in industry and government will also be a part of the symposium. The symposium is expected to provide a forum for analysing and assessing the progress achieved in pursuit of this goal and to explore the foundations of and emerging directions in service research.

The symposium is sponsored by the Service Science Society of Australia. This is the apex national body representing the services research community of Australia. It seeks to promote the understanding and use of service science in government, industry and academia. The Australasian Symposium on Service Research and Innovation series also serves as its annual meeting.

PAPER SUBMISSION, SYMPOSIUM PUBLICATIONS, AND BEST PAPER AWARDS:

There are three tracks in the second part of ASSRI'18: a) Research, b) Demos, and c) Service Innovation Challenge. 

We invite submissions of exciting and novel findings in the interest areas of the conference for the research track. The research paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of 6 pages in the Springer LNBIP format (see http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). 

Demo submissions must be based on the implemented systems and innovative ideas. The demo paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of 6 pages in the Springer LNBIP format (see http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). 

In the service innovation challenge track, authors should explain a significant challenge in service science and propose a solution (algorithm/design/architecture/framework) to address the problem. Details about the challenge is found here: http://www.servicesciencesociety.org.au/downloads/ch.pdf. The submissions in service innovation challenge track should be limited to a maximum of 3 pages in the Springer LNBIP format (see http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). 

All submissions will be reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of overall quality, relevance to service research, originality, significance, and clarity. Please submit papers through EasyChair. ASSRI proceedings are traditionally published under the Springer LNBIP series.

NOTE: All paper submissions should be made through EasyChair (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=assri18) conference management system.
