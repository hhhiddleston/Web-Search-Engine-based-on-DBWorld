Since the invention of Bitcoin in 2008, blockchain has emerged as a potential technology to disrupt traditional database systems. Over the past decade, it has found numerous applications in finance, IoT, healthcare, supply chain, e-commerce, and so on, and is becoming a hot research area. In contrast to traditional database systems, blockchain is decentralized, immutable, and cryptographically secured, where no single entity has full control. This new technology has significantly changed the way of data access, storage, retrieval and information discovery. It presents many fundamental research challenges for management of data in blockchain. 

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners working on blockchain systems from different data management aspects, including storage management, fault tolerance, query processing, information discovery, transaction management, security and privacy. We encourage papers that apply ideas and techniques from different areas to understand the problems and challenges in blockchain systems and propose innovative solutions. We also welcome papers that report novel systems and applications built with blockchain technology. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: 

- Blockchain data management 
- Blockchain data provenance 
- Blockchain consensus and fault tolerance mechanisms 
- Blockchain system design, performance and optimization 
- Blockchain storage management 
- Data security, privacy and trust in blockchain 
- Information retrieval on blockchain 
- Data mining and knowledge discovery on blockchain 
- Query processing on blockchain 
- Transaction management on blockchain 
- Smart contract and distributed ledger 
- Innovative applications driven by blockchain
