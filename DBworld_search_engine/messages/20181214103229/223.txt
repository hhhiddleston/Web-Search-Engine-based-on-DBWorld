11TH CONFERENCE OF THE EUROPEAN SOCIETY FOR FUZZY LOGIC AND TECHNOLOGY (EUSFLAT 2019)

SPECIAL SESSION “FUZZY METHODS IN DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY”


DESCRIPTION

The objective of the special session is to provide a forum for the discussion of recent advances in the development and application of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery technologies to diverse problems, focusing on those involving fuzzy methods, and to offer an opportunity for researchers to identify new and promising research directions.
Data Mining aims at the automatic discovery of underlying non-trivial knowledge from datasets by applying intelligent analysis techniques. The interest in this research area has experienced a considerable growth in the last years due to two key factors: (a) knowledge hidden in organizations’ databases can be exploited to improve strategic and managerial decision-making in the current ultra-competitive markets; (b) the large volume of data managed by organizations makes it impossible to carry out an analysis process manually. 

Nowadays, the volume of information digitally stored has considerably increased not only in database format but also in text format which is available in open source bases such as the Web, including log files registering the use of the information or social media content. This has contributed to increase the interest on Text and Web Mining techniques. In one hand, these techniques aim to automatize the analysis process by introducing a variety of intelligent techniques to learn, optimize and represent uncertain and imprecise knowledge. On the other hand, these tools offer the possibility to analyze massive data offering more efficient algorithms and a suitable selection of obtained results in terms of their novelty, usefulness and interpretability.

Keywords: Data Mining, Knowledge Discovery, Text Mining, Big Data analysis

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following topics: 

- Imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness in data mining 
- Data, text and web mining 
- Stream data mining 
- Temporal data series 
- Big data mining 
- Data mining for security
- Data pre- and post- processing in data mining
- Parallel and distributed data mining algorithms 
- Information summarization and visualization 
- Human-machine interaction for data access  
- Semantic models to represent input data and extracted knowledge in a Data Mining process
- Applications of Data Mining techniques: health, tourism, biological process, customer profiles, anomaly detection, emergency management, situation recognition, etc.

IMPORTANT DATES

Paper submission: February 1st, 2019
Notification of acceptance: April 1st, 2019
Early/author registration, April 15th, 2019
Conference: September 9-13th, 2019

FORMAT AND TYPE OF PUBLICATIONS

1. The format of the contributions is available in the conference web page:
http://eusflat2019.cz/submission.html
2. There are two types of contributions - full papers vs. abstracts (short but explanatory from the content point of view).
3. Each talk will be accompanied by a single submission - either by an abstract or by a full paper, not by both.  
4. All contributions will be submitted via EasyChair.
5. Each submission will go through two steps. In the first step, the author has to choose the track (abstract vs. full paper). In the second step, the author can choose the special session number (3) and title (Fuzzy methods in Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery).
6. Each conference talk should be accompanied by a single publication: either an abstract or a full paper. Do not submit both types of publications related to a single talk.
