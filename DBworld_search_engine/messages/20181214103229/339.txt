*** FIRST CALL FOR TUTORIAL PROPOSALS *** 

27th ACM International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation
and Personalization (ACM UMAP 2019)

Golden Bay Beach Hotel 5*, Larnaca, Cyprus, June 9-12, 2019

https://www.um.org/umap2019/


Proposals due:     February 11, 2019


ACM UMAP 2019, the premier international conference for researchers and
practitioners working on systems that adapt to individual users or to groups
of users, and which collect, represent, and model user information, is
pleased to invite proposals for tutorials to be given in conjunction with the
conference. Tutorials are intensive instructional sessions aimed to provide a
comprehensive introduction to established or emerging research topics of
interest for the UMAP community.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
¥ new user modeling technologies, methods, techniques, and trends
(e.g. exploiting data mining and big data analytics for user modeling,
evaluation methodologies, data visualization, etc.);
¥ user modeling and personalization techniques for specific domains
(e.g., health sciences, e-government, e-commerce, cultural heritage,
education, internet of things, mobile, music, information retrieval, etc.);
¥ application of user modeling and personalization techniques for
information retrieval and recommender systems;
¥ eliciting and learning user preferences by taking into account usersÕ
emotional state, physical state, personality, trust, cognitive factors.
 
An ideal tutorial should be broad enough to provide a basic introduction to
the chosen area, but it should also cover the most important topics in depth.
Tutorial presenters can have one page in the adjunct proceedings. 


PROPOSAL FORMAT AND SUBMISSION

Tutorial proposals should be submitted in PDF format to both tutorial chairs,
not exceeding 5 pages and containing the following information:
1. Title and abstract of the tutorial for inclusion on the ACM UMAP 2019
website (200 words maximum).
2. Tutorial description:
¥ learning objectives of the tutorial and relevance to ACM UMAP 2019;
¥ targeted audience (introductory, intermediate, advanced) and
prerequisite knowledge or skills;
¥ a brief outline of the tutorial structure;
¥ practical sessions.
3. Tutorial length: full (6 hours) or half day (3 hours).
4. Other venues to which the tutorial or part thereof has been or will be
presented, in addition to explaining how the current tutorial differs from the
other editions.
5. Name, email address, affiliation and brief professional biography of
the tutorial instructor(s), indicating previous training and speaking
experience.


IMPORTANT DATES

¥ Tutorial proposals: February 11, 2019
¥ Notification of acceptance: February 26, 2019
¥ Tutorial summary camera-ready: April 3, 2019

EVALUATION CRITERIA

All proposals will be reviewed by the tutorial chairs. The features that will
be evaluated are:
1.   ability of the tutorial to contribute to strengthening the foundations
of UMAP research;
2.   clarity of the tutorial, which should emerge from its description;
3.   good organization, as appearing from the outline;
4.   background/experience of tutorial instructor(s) in teaching the
target topics.
