Network security team[SdR] in Telecom ParisTech invites expressions of interest in view of the opening of a position: Research Engineer in Cyber Security.

The position will be fixed-term for 1 or 2 years, with possibility of extension. This position is associated with a European project titled "SCOOP@F".

SCOOP@F is a pilot project for the deployment of cooperative intelligent transport systems, i.e. systems based on the exchange of information between vehicles and between vehicles and roads. Vehicles are equipped with sensors to detect events such as a slippery road, an emergency brake, etc. and with on-board units to transmit the information to vehicles behind (V2V) and to the road operator (V2I) through road side units. The road operator can also transmit information (roadworks, etc.) to the vehicles through their on board units (I2V). SCOOP@F federates numerous public and private partners around the Ministry of Environment, Energy and the Sea, who acts as as coordinator : local authorities, road operators, car manufacturers PSA and Renault, universities and research institutes. Since January 2016, a telecom operator, a trust services provider and Austrian, Spanish and Portuguese partners have joined the project.

SCOOP aims at deploying 3000 vehicles over 2000 km of roads, on five sites : Ile-de-France, Paris-Strasbourg highway, IsÃ¨re, the ring road of Bordeaux, Bretagne. These sites are characterized by a great diversity of road types (motorways, structuring roads in the metropolitan area, bi-directional interurban and local roads). One of the objectives of SCOOP@F is to improve road safety, but also the security of the road maintenance agents who intervene on the roads for construction works and other maintenance operations.


The main purpose of the security work-package in SCOOP@F led by TelecomParistech is to design and to develop tools for validation and testing the designed C-ITS security schemes.
In the context of this research project, your responsibilities will be:

- Designing and developing software for test and validation of C-ITS PKI and its associated security paradigms.
- Validation of hybrid security architecture

using appropriate research techniques and methods, writing up research results and dissemination through publications, deliverables, seminar and conference presentations and outreach activities, and contributing to the identification of possible new areas of research.

We are looking for a candidate with strong track records in one or more of the following areas:
* Security protocol ( TLS IPSEC, etc..)
* Security in cooperatie Intelligent Transportation system
* Artificial Intelligence

and familiar with:
* Network simulation
* Programming language ( C, java, Python...)

Essential personal attributes for this role include attention to detail and commitment to high quality, a collaborative ethos, positive attitude to colleagues, commitment to personal development, and ability to plan and prioritize own work to meet deadlines. Experience in collaborative research projects, especially in European projects, will be considered as an asset.
