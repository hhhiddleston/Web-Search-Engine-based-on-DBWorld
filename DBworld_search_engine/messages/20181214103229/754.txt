SCOPE AND LIST OF TOPICS:

   The 2018 CSCI International Conference invites paper submissions from
   diverse communities, including researchers from: universities,
   corporations, government agencies, and standardization bodies. Papers
   are sought that address solutions to problems in all areas of
   computational science and computational intelligence.

   Computational Science is the study of addressing problems that are
   impossible to solve (or difficult to solve) without computers. The
   field is interdisciplinary by nature and includes the use of advanced
   computing capabilities to understand and solve complex problems. In
   short, Computational Science is the science of using computers to do
   science. Computational Intelligence is the study of computational
   methods in ways that exhibit intelligence. These methods adapt to
   changing environments and changing goals.

   Considering the above broad outline, the International Conference on
   Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI'18) is
   composed of the following research and technical tracks:

   - Computational Science (CSCI-ISCS)
   - Computational Intelligence (CSCI-ISCI)
   - Cyber Warfare, Cyber Defense, & Cyber Security (CSCI-ISCW)
   - Signal & Image Processing, Computer Vision & Pattern
     Recognition (CSCI-ISPC)
   - Smart Cities and Smart Mobility (CSCI-ISSC)
   - Education (CSCI-ISED) - includes accreditation, such as ABET
   - Health Informatics and Medical Systems (CSCI-ISHI)
   - Mobile Computing, Wireless Networks, & Security (CSCI-ISMC)
   - Software Engineering (CSCI-ISSE)
   - Internet of Things & Internet of Everything (CSCI-ISOT)
   - Big Data and Data Science (CSCI-ISBD)
   - Artificial Intelligence (CSCI-ISAI)
   - Social Network Analysis, Social Media, & Mining (CSCI-ISNA)
   - Cloud Computing and Data Centers (CSCI-ISCC)
   - Computational Biology (CSCI-ISCB)
   - Parallel & Distributed Computing (CSCI-ISPD)

TYPE OF SUBMISSIONS/PAPERS:

  - Full/Regular Research Papers (maximum of 6 pages):
    Regular Research Papers should provide detail original research
    contributions. They must report new research results that represent
    a contribution to the field; sufficient details and support for
    the results and conclusions should also be provided. The work
    presented in regular papers are expected to be at a stage of
    maturity that with some additional work can be published as journal
    papers.

  - Short Papers (maximum of 4 pages):
    Short papers report on ongoing research projects. They should provide
    overall research methodologies with some results. The work presented
    in short papers are expected to be at a stage of maturity that with
    some additional work can be published as regular papers.

  - Poster Papers (maximum of 2 pages):
    Poster papers report on ongoing research projects that are still in
    their infancy (i.e., at very early stages). Such papers tend to
    provide research methodologies without yet concrete results.


REVIEW PROCESS

   Each paper will be peer-reviewed by 2 to 4 peers (except for papers that
   are philosophical in nature - such papers would be considered for panel
   discussions.) Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained.
   Papers will be evaluated on the basis of originality, impact, significance,
   quality of research, quality of writing, and contribution to conference
   program and diversity. Papers whose authors include one or more members
   of the program committee will be evaluated using the double-blinded
   review process. Authors whose papers are not selected for publication
   can submit a rebuttal letter; rebuttals will be evaluated by 4 members
   of the Program Committee.
