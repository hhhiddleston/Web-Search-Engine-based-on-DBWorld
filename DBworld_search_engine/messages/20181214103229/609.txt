Two Tenure Track Northwestern Mutual Assistant Professor Positions in Computer Science Available for Fall 2019
 
The Department of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science of Marquette University invites applications for two tenure-track Northwestern Mutual Assistant Professor positions in computer science to begin in August 2019 within the new Department of Computer Science (on track to launch in Fall 2019). The Department seek individuals with a doctorate by time of appointment in computer science or a closely related field, whose area of expertise addresses one of the many facets of the broadly defined areas in data science and big data. Examples include data-focused research in machine learning, computational biology / bioinformatics, data science foundations / algorithms, security, visualization, human computer interaction, cloud computing, and mHealth / global health. Candidates with research in other areas with similar data science emphasis will be considered and are encouraged to apply. Exceptional candidates with research interests in other areas related to computer science will also be considered. Preference will be given to applicants whose strong research record demonstrates potential for establishing an externally funded research program, and who can contribute to the proposed Ph.D. program in Computer Science and the current Ph.D. program in Computational Sciences. Furthermore, candidates should demonstrate the ability to teach at the undergraduate and the graduate levels, and have excellent oral, written, and interpersonal skills.

The Department highly regards and encourages interdisciplinary research in both academia and industry. Marquette University has experienced significant growth in Computer Science, Data Science, and affiliated areas. Marquette has recently partnered with Northwestern Mutual on a $40 million venture to establish the Northwestern Mutual Data Science Institute. This venture will provide research opportunities for the existing and new faculty members. For more information about the current Department and its programs, see http://www.marquette.edu/mscs/.
