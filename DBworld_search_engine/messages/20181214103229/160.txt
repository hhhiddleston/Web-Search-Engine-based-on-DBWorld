Submission Guidelines
Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Papers must be clearly presented in English, must not exceed 8 pages, including tables, figures, references and appendixes, in IEEE Computer Society proceedings format with Portable Document Format (.pdf). Please submit your paper via https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ieeetrustcom2019

Papers will be selected based on their originality, timeliness, significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation. Submission of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present the work. Accepted and presented papers will be included in the IEEE CPS Proceedings. Distinguished papers presented at the conference, after further revision, will be recommended to high quality international journals.
