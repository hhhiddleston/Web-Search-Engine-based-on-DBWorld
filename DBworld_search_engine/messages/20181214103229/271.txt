We are writing to let you know about the third edition of SIGMOD's ACM student 
research competition. It involves three rounds of competition: 
(i) students will be judged by their extended abstract on their work, which should 
be submitted on the CMT (http://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/sigmodsrc2019) by 
November 16th; 
(ii) selected students will be invited to round two, which is a poster session 
held during SIGMOD; 
(iii) the selected finalists will be asked to give a short talk the following day. 
The winners are announced during the business lunch.

All students invited for round two and three will receive a $500 sponsorship 
from ACM to cover for their travel expenses to the conference. Furthermore, 
we are working together with SIGMOD sponsorship chairs to accommodate 
complementary conference registration fee.

The competition has two categories, one for undergraduate and one for graduate 
students. The top three winners from each category will receive monetary prizes 
and ACM membership (along with something shiny on their CV). And the top 
graduate and undergraduate student will each advance to an ACM-wide research 
competition (see http://src.acm.org for details)!

We believe that the event is a great platform for students to gain exposure 
across all of ACM and receive feedback on their research project and presentation 
skills. We hope you will encourage your students to submit an abstract by 
November 16th.

More information and eligibility requirements can be found on the webpage

you have any questions.

Thank you,
