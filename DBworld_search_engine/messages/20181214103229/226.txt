Final call for PhD symposium papers

The ICDE 2019 PhD Symposium provides a forum for PhD students to present their research ideas, and interact with and receive feedback from senior members of the research community, in academia and industry. The focus of the Symposium is on mentorship and providing constructive feedback to the students. The Symposium fosters a collaborative environment, encouraging constructive discussions and sharing of ideas. We expect a number of the members of the Program Committee to attend the symposium. The symposium will provide opportunities for discussions and feedback.

Submissions are encouraged from students who have not yet received their PhD degrees.

Submissions from students who are in the early stages of their research should provide a clear statement of the problem being addressed, and a clear outline of the planned methodology. Submissions from students who are farther into their research should clearly state the contributions made so far, and the work lying ahead.

The submitted manuscripts should be at most five-pages long and the student should be the single author. The manuscripts should contain the statement of the problem being addressed, an outline of the planned methodology, contributions made so far, and the work lying ahead.

Students with accepted papers will be required to make a brief presentation, as well as prepare and present a poster during the poster presentation event of the main conference.

Accepted papers will be published by IEEE as an ICDE workshop, and will be indexed by DBLP and IEEE Xplore.
