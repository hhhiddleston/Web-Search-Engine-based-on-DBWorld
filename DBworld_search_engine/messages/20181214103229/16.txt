Call for Papers
===============

Location has quickly moved into the mainstream of the (mobile) Web and it continues to be a strong driver of applications and research activities. The general appeal and usefulness of geo- located data (e.g., for information access with freely available mapping services) are only some of the reasons for its fast rise. After the initial boost and consolidation of approaches based on the simple use of geospatial coordinates, we see an increasing demand for (i) more sophisticated systems, (ii) stronger retrieval, mining, and analytics solutions, and (iii) more powerful semantics. Location plays a key role as a context factor for users, and it is also of paramount importance to consider the implicit or explicit place of resources and people in the physical world. It is an important factor in mobile and geo-social applications and it drives geospatially-aware Web data mining. Focusing on static and dynamic spatio-social networks allows to understand how people are influenced by social interaction in their daily life decision, e.g., travel, flight booking, hotel recommendation, purchases, leisure, search, etc. 

LocWeb 2019 will continue a successful workshop series at the intersection of location-based services and Web architecture. It focuses on Web-scale services and systems facilitating location-aware information access as well as on Spatial Social Behavior Analytics on the Web as part of social computing.

LocWeb addresses location as a cross-cutting issue in web research and technology that connects the online world to the physical spatial world. It examines location aspects in the domains of social computing, search, analytics, mobility, apps, services, standards, and systems. The aspect of social computing will have a particular focus on spatio-social networks, i.e., social network usersâ€™ behaviors, activities, interactions, news propagation, and social influence learning models in the context of available spatial or location information. We are particularly interested in new tools and techniques for the modeling and analysis of dynamic spatio-social networks. One hurdle has been the disconnect between activities in the online and physical worlds. We welcome work to understand this disconnect and develop methods and techniques to bridge this gap.

LocWeb will solicit submissions under the main theme of Web-scale Location-Aware Information Access and spatial social computing. Subtopics include (i) geospatial semantics, systems, and standards; (ii) large-scale geospatial and geo-social ecosystems; (iii) mobility; (iv) location in the Web of Things; and (v) mining and searching geospatial data on the Web. The workshop encourages work describing Web-mediated or Web-scale approaches that build on reliable foundations, and that thoroughly understand and embrace the geospatial dimension.

Submission Instructions
=======================

We solicit full papers of 6-8 pages, and short papers of up to 4 pages describing work-in-progress or early results. Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research that is not being considered for publication in any other forum.

Workshop submissions will be evaluated based on the quality of the work, originality, match to the workshop themes, technical merit, and their potential to inspire interesting discussions. The review process is single blind, so please provide your name and affiliation.

Please submit to the LocWeb workshop through Easychair at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=locweb2019

Submissions should follow the ACM styles and guidelines of the WebConf conference proceedings.

Accepted workshop papers will be published in the WWW companion proceedings and the ACM Digital Library.

For inclusion in the proceedings, at least one author of the accepted paper has to register for the workshop and present the paper.

Presenters are encouraged to bring demos to the workshop, to facilitate discussion and make the workshop more interactive.
