*** FIRST CALL FOR DEMOS AND LATE BREAKING RESULTS *** 

27th ACM International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation
and Personalization (ACM UMAP 2019)

Golden Bay Beach Hotel 5*, Larnaca, Cyprus, June 9-12, 2019

https://www.um.org/umap2019/


Submissions due:     March 16, 2019


ACM UMAP - User Modelling, Adaptation and Personalization is the premier
international conference for researchers and practitioners working on
systems that adapt to individual users, to groups of users, and that collect,
represent, and model user information. 

ACM UMAP 2019 invites Demonstrations and Late-Breaking Results (LBR)
papers of innovative UMAP-based systems (including research prototypes). 

You are encouraged to submit your Demo or LBR by March 16th 2019.


DEMONSTRATIONS

Demonstrations will showcase research prototypes and commercially
available products in a dedicated session. Demo submissions must be based
on an implemented and tested system that pursues one or more innovative
ideas in the interest areas of the conference.

Demonstrations are an excellent and exciting way to showcase
implementations and to get valuable feedback from the community. Each
demo submission must make clear which aspects of the system will be
demonstrated, and how.

To better identify the value of demos, we also encourage authors to submit
a pointer to a screencast (max. 5 minutes on Vimeo or YouTube) or to any
external material related to the demo (e.g., shared code on GitHub).

Descriptions of demonstrations should have a length of max. 2 pages in
the ACM SIG proceedings template. On an extra page (not to be published),
submissions should include a specification of the technical requirements
for demonstrating the system at UMAP 2019.


LATE-BREAKING RESULTS

Late-Breaking Results (LBR) are research-in-progress that must contain
original and unpublished accounts of innovative research ideas, preliminary
results, industry showcases, and system prototypes, addressing both the
theory and practice of User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization. In
addition, papers introducing recently started research projects or
summarizing project results are welcome as well. 

We encourage researchers and practitioners to submit a late-breaking work
as it provides a unique opportunity for sharing valuable ideas, eliciting
useful feedback on early-stage work, and fostering discussions and
collaborations among colleagues. 

Late-Breaking Results papers have a length of 4 to 6 pages in the ACM SIG
proceedings template and will be presented to the conference as posters.


SUBMISSION AND REVIEW PROCESS

Submissions (demos and late-breaking results) must adhere to the ACM SIG
Standard (SIGCONF) proceedings template.  
A template can be found at:
https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template .

Submit your papers in PDF format via EasyChair for ACM UMAP 2019 Demos and Late-Breaking Results at:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=umap2019_demo-lbr .

The review process will be single blinded, i.e. authors' names should be
included in the papers. 

Submissions will be reviewed by at least two independent reviewers. They
will be assessed based on their originality and novelty, potential contribution
to the research field, potential impact in particular use cases, and the
usefulness of presented experiences, as well as their overall readability. 

Papers that exceed the page limits (2 pages for demos and 6 pages for LBR)
or do not adhere to the formatting guidelines will be returned without review.


IMPORTANT DATES

¥ Submission of demos and LBR papers: March 16th, 2019 
¥ Notification of acceptance: April 5th, 2019
¥ Camera-ready versions of accepted papers: April 15th, 2019 

The submissions times are 11:59 pm Anywhere on Earth


PUBLICATION AND PRESENTATION

Accepted Demo and Late Breaking Results papers will be published in the
ACM UMAP 2019 Adjunct Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. All
categories will be presented at the poster reception of the conference, in the
form of a poster and/or a software demonstration following poster format. 
This form of presentation will provide presenters with an opportunity to
obtain direct feedback about their work from a wide audience during the
conference. 

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference
and present the paper there.
