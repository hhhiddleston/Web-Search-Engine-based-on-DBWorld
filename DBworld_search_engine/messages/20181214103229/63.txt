**********************************************************************************

AIMS:

AlCoB aims at promoting and displaying excellent research using string and graph algorithms and combinatorial optimization to deal with problems in biological sequence analysis, genome rearrangement, evolutionary trees, and structure prediction.

Previous events were held in Tarragona, Mexico City, Trujillo (Spain), Aveiro, and Hong Kong.

The conference will address several of the current challenges in computational biology by investigating algorithms aimed at:

1) assembling sequence reads into a complete genome,
2) identifying gene structures in the genome,
3) recognizing regulatory motifs,
4) aligning nucleotides and comparing genomes,
5) reconstructing regulatory networks of genes, and
6) inferring the evolutionary phylogeny of species.

Special focus will be put on methodology and significant room will be reserved to young scholars at the beginning of their career.

VENUE:

AlCoB 2019 will take place in Berkeley, home to the oldest campus in the highly prestigious University of California system. The venue will be:

University of California, Berkeley
