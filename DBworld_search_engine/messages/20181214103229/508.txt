New Humanities: The Ethico-Critical Imperative

In its after-life, Literary Theory appears to have tempered its rhetoric of suspicion and cynicism with an ethical requisite, the latter being forced into collective reckoning by the precarious situation of human beings as a species. The plunder of natural resources under an irrational system of production, the destruction of the metabolic connection between (wo)man and earth, and the economic deprivation-marginalization of people on an unprecedented, global scale, have resulted in the new-found emphasis on `species being`. Academic spaces are turning into contestatory sites, wherein the ethos of advanced capitalism is being resisted, with humanities taking the lead.         
The inaugural issue of Alteritas: EFL-U Journal of Literary Inquiry is devoted to a discussion on positions/propositions that can potentially lead to radical alternatives to the social formations of the present.

The focus of this inaugural issue will be on the following sub-themes:

• Reinventing the Human: Categories and Pseudo-Categories, Strategic Essentialism and Other Counter-Discursive Strategies in Philosophy, Anthropology, Sociology, and Literary Theory… 
• Grasping/Outlining Horizontal, Non-Hierarchical Social Structures: New Insights on Ephemeral Communities, the Socious and Pre-Modern Rituals and Celebrations, the Carnivalesque in Contemporary Society…  
• Creating Discursive Spaces for Communication in a Post-Truth Society: After “Communicative Reason”, the Narrative Philosophy Alternative, the Communicative Potential of Conversation…
• Defining the Contours of a Progressive New Humanities: Critical Engagement with  Consumerisms, Commodity Culture, Populism, and other Ideologies of Post- Capitalism, Assembling/ Disseminating Ecological Consciousness..
