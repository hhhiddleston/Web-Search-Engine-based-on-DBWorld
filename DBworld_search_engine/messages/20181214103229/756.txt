WSDM- WISC’18

February 15th, 2019, Melbourne, Australia
https://sites.google.com/view/wsdm19wisc/home

Web-based information sources such as online traffic information systems, online news, online sensors, online location-based services, and online social media provide dynamic information of a city. However, to advance towards smart city, there are essential tasks to be solved, including acquisition, integration, and analysis of big and heterogeneous data generated by a diversity of sources in urban spaces. The targeted audiences of the workshop are data science researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and government who have special interest in smart city, urban computing, location-based services, location-based community, geography & location data analysis, social networks and other related topics. As a special interest group of attendants of WSDM, this workshop aims to attract from all over the world data science researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and government who have special interest in smart city, urban computing, location-based services, location-based community, geography & location data analysis, social networks and other related topicsworking in the field of social computing. Research topics include, but are not limited to:

– Social behavior modeling and patterns mining in urban spaces
– City-wide traffic modeling, visualization, analysis, and prediction
– City-wide human mobility modeling, visualization, and understanding
– City-wide intelligent transportation systems
– City-wide mobile social applications in urban areas
– Location-based social networks enabling urban computing scenarios
– Mining urban economics
– Data mining for urban planning and city configuration evaluation
– Mining urban environmental, pollution, and ecological data
– Knowledge discovery from sensor data for saving energy and resources
– Urban sensing and city dynamics sensing
– Knowledge fusion from data across different domains
– Anomaly detection and event discovery in urban areas
– Joint modeling of unstructured and structured urban data from the web and Internet of Things
– Knowledge and semantic analysis of urban data

Submission Information

All papers will be peer reviewed, single-blinded. We welcome many kinds of papers below (not limited to):
-   Novel research papers

-   Appraisal papers of existing methods and tools (e.g., lessons learned)

-   Demo papers

-   Work-in-progress papers

-   Visionary papers (white papers)

-   Relevant work that has been previously published
Authors should clearly indicate in their abstracts the kinds of submissions that the papers belong to, to help reviewers better understand their contributions. Submissions must be in PDF, written in English, no more than 10 pages long — shorter papers (including extended abstracts) are also welcome — and formatted according to the standard double-column ACM Sigconf Proceedings Style. The accepted papers will be posted on the workshop website and will not appear in the KDD proceedings. The submission site is https://easychair.org/conferences/submission_show_all.cgi?a=19978963

Important Dates 

• Workshop abstract/paper submissions: 15 November, 2018
• Workshop paper notification: 1 December, 2018
• Camera-ready deadline and copyright forms: 14 December, 2018
