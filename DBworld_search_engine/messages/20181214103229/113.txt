    Funded as an NSF grant to train graduate students, post-docs, and junior faculty on â€œBig Data + High-Performance Computing + Atmospheric Sciencesâ€, our training program is a new NSF-funded initiative in big data applied to atmospheric sciences and using high-performance computing as a vital tool. The training consists of instruction in the areas of data, computing, and atmospheric sciences supported by teaching assistants, followed by faculty-guided project research in a multidisciplinary team of participants from each area. Participants around the nation will be exposed to multidisciplinary research experiences and have the opportunity for significant career growth.

    Extending on top of the face-to-face training we had in 2018, we will offer an online course in Spring 2019 (Weekly from 01/28/2019 to 05/17/2019). We welcome graduate students, post-docs, and early career faculty from US institutes to apply. Each person who finishes the program will receive $1,500 stipend. Application deadline is 01/01/2019. The flyer of the program is at http://cybertraining.umbc.edu/docs/UMBC_CyberTraining_Spring_2019.pdf and more information can be found at http://cybertraining.umbc.edu/. Please contact us at cybertraining@umbc.edu for questions and inquiries. 

    You are welcome to disseminate the opportunity to your colleagues and students. Thanks!
