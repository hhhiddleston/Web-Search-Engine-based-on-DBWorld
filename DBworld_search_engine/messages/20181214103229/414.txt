Blockchain - the technology behind Bitcoin, Ethereum and many other cryptocurrencies - is flourishing into an impressive spectrum of research projects and initiatives, corporate alliances, and startup companies. This multidisciplinary effort spans diverse disciplines ranging from Computer Science and Engineering to Communications, Social Sciences, Public Policy, Banking and Finance, Journalism, and Political Sciences to name a few. This one day symposium builds on the previous success of FAB 2018 (https://scfab.github.io/2018/), attended by close to a hundred participants and featuring presentations by distinguished speakers from academia and industry.  We strive to once again bring researchers and practitioners of blockchain together to share and exchange new ideas and results, and are interested in papers and presentations on a broad range of topics including:
Application use cases of blockchain
Secure smart contracts
Bitcoin and cryptocurrency
Blockchain for social networking
Distributed systems for blockchain
Blockchain consensus protocols
Blockchain and Governance 
Blockchains and network systems
Partitioned and replicated data stores for blockchain
Transactions and blockchain
Software engineering practices and life cycle management of blockchain
Societal impact and social aspects of blockchain
