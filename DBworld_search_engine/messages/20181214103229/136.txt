SMDB 2019
10th International Workshop on Self-Managing Database Systems

WORKSHOP INFORMATION

Autonomic, or self-managing, systems are a promising approach to
achieve the goal of systems to be easier to use, simpler to maintain,
and more robust in their operating characteristics. A system is
considered to be autonomic if it is self-configuring, self-optimizing,
self-healing, and/or self-protecting. The aim of the SMDB workshop is
to provide a forum for researchers from both industry and academia to
present and discuss ideas and experiences related to self-management
and self-organization in all areas of Information Management in
general. SMDB targets not only classical databases, but also the new
generation of storage engines and in-memory databases. Beyond
databases, SMDB aims to cover autonomic aspects of data-intensive
systems represented by large-scale map-reduce and cloud environments,
where much work on self-management is needed. Last, but not least,
SMDB seeks to expand its horizons to include self-management of
non-traditional, new areas such as social networks, distributed
gaming, and peer-to-peer systems.

The series of SMDB workshops have always been held in conjunction with
IEEE ICDE. Early workshops of the SMDB series focused on core topics
in self-managing databases such as automated tuning and provisioning,
automated problem diagnosis and recovery, and automated data
protection and integration. Since 2010 the scope of the workshop has
been broadened to include new topics in the core database area, such
as multi-tenant databases and data management in cloud computing, but
also drawing in other communities, such as, peer-to-peer computing and
distributed systems. For the SMDB 2019 workshop, we want to continue
to attract researchers from both the core database and other
communities, such as the adaptive, data stream and event-based systems
communities as enabling technologies for self-managing systems, and
data-intensive internet-scale distributed systems that utilize the
recent advances in AI, machine learning and data mining and analysis.

TOPICS OF INTEREST
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Principles and architecture of autonomic data management systems
