== CALL FOR PAPERS ==

The Program Committee of the 16th European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence (JELIA 2019) invites the submission of technical papers for the conference that will be held in Rende, Italy, from May 8th to May 10th, 2019. The aim of JELIA 2019 is to bring together active researchers interested in all aspects concerning the use of logics in Artificial Intelligence to discuss current research, results, problems, and applications of both theoretical and practical nature. JELIA strives to foster links and facilitate cross-fertilization of ideas among researchers from various disciplines, among researchers from academia and industry, and between theoreticians and practitioners.

== AWARDS AND PRIZES ==
The Best Paper and the Best Student Paper of the conference will receive a cash prize of EUR 500 each, offered by Springer.

Two high-quality papers of the conference that are suitable for presentation to a general AI audience, will be invited for publication (of abridged versions) to the IJCAI 2019 Sister Conference Best Paper Track.

The authors of the top-notch contributions (from 3 to 6 papers, including both best papers) will be invited to submit long and more elaborate versions of their work for a special issue of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).

== RELEVANT TOPICS ==

Conference topics include, but are not limited to: 
* Abductive and inductive reasoning
* Answer set programming
* Applications of logic-based AI systems
* Argumentation systems
* Automated reasoning including satisfiability checking and its extensions
* Computational complexity and expressiveness
* Deep learning for rules and ontologies
* Deontic logic and normative systems
* Description logics and other logical approaches to Semantic Web and ontologies
* Explanation finding
* Knowledge representation, reasoning, and compilation
* Logic programming, answer set programming, constraint logic programming
* Logic-based data access and integration
* Logical interpretation of machine learning models
* Logics for uncertain and probabilistic reasoning
* Logics in machine learning
* Logics in multi-agent systems, games, and social choice

For formatting guidelines, see more information on https://jelia2019.mat.unical.it/submission

JELIA 2019 welcomes submissions of long or short papers in the following categories: 

Regular papers. Submissions should contain original research, and sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the contribution. Submissions must not have been previously published or be simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere.

System/Application descriptions. Submissions should describe an implemented system/application and its application area(s). A demonstration should accompany a system/application presentation. Papers describing systems or applications that have already been presented in JELIA before will be accepted only if significant and clear enhancements have been implemented and are properly reported.

All submissions should not exceed 13 (resp., 6) pages for long (resp., short) papers, including figures etc., but excluding references, and should be written in English. All submissions (both long and short) may also include an appendix with no restriction in length containing, for example, proofs of theorems that are stated in the main submission, or relevant parts of source code. Reviewers will make their evaluations based on the main submission, and are not obligated to read the appendix. However, if proofs or other supplement matter are an important part of the contribution, their essential elements should be included in the main submission. Moreover, appendix will not be part of the camera-ready and it may only be a publicly available online resource. Submissions must be formatted according to the standard Springer LNCS style, and are not anonymous. The conference proceedings of JELIA 2019 will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, a sub-series of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Important note: Springer will require all the LaTeX source files of all accepted submissions).

== POLICY ON MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS ==

JELIA 2019 will not accept any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference. Authors are also required not to submit their papers elsewhere during JELIA's review period. However, these restrictions do not apply to previous workshops with a limited audience and without archival proceedings.
