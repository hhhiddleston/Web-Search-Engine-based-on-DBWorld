                                   Workshop Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview: Recently, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field has been
experiencing a resurgence. AI broadly covers a wide swath of
techniques which include logic-based approaches, probabilistic
graphical models, and machine learning/deep learning
approaches. Advances in hardware capabilities, such as Graphics
Processing Units (GPUs), software components (e.g., accelerated
libraries, programming frameworks), and systems infrastructures
(e.g., GPU-enabled cloud providers) has led to a wide-spread
adaptation of AI techniques to a variety of domains. Examples of such
domains include image classification, autonomous driving, automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and conversational systems (chatbots). AI
solutions not only support multiple datatypes (e.g., free text,
images, or speech), but are also available in various configurations,
from personal devices to large-scale distributed systems.  

In spite of the wide ranging applications of AI techniques, its
interactions with the data management systems remains in infancy. At
present, a majority of database management systems (DBMS) are being
used primarily as a repository for feeding input data and storing
results. Recently, there has been some activity in using AI techniques
in data management systems, e.g., enabling natural language interfaces
to relational databases and applying machine learning techniques for
query optimizations. However, a lot more needs to done to fully
exploit the power of AI for data management workloads. 

We propose to organize a one-day workshop that will bring together
people from academia and industry to discuss various ways of
integrating AI techniques with data management systems. The primary
goal of the proposed workshop is to explore opportunities for AI
techniques for enhancing different components of the data management
systems, e.g., user interfaces, tooling, performance optimizations,
new query types, and workloads. Special emphasis would be given to
transparent exploitation of AI techniques using existing data
management for enterprise class workloads. We hope this workshop will
identify important areas of research and spur new efforts in this
emerging field.

                                 Topics of Interest 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of the workshop is to take a holistic view of various AI
technologies and investigate how they can be applied to different
component of an end-to-end data management pipeline. Special emphasis
would be given to how AI techniques could be used for enhancing user
experience by reducing complexity in tools, or providing newer
insights, or providing better user interfaces. Topics of interest
include, but are not restricted to: 

â€¢ Characterizing different AI approaches: Logic-based, Probabilistic
  Graphical models, and machine learning/deep learning approaches
â€¢ Evaluation of different learning approaches: unsupervised learning,
 supervised or reinforced learning, transfer learning, zero-shot learning,..
â€¢ New AI-enabled business intelligence (BI) queries for relational databases
â€¢ Natural language queries/result summarization and conversational interfaces
â€¢ Issues with explanability/interpretability
â€¢ Evaluating quality of approximate results from AI-enabled queries
â€¢ Supporting multiple datatypes (e.g., images or time-series data)
â€¢ Supporting semi-structured, streaming, and graph databases
â€¢ Reasoning over knowledge bases
â€¢ Integrating structured and unstructured data sources
â€¢ AI-enabled data integration strategies
â€¢ Impact of AI on tooling, e.g., ETL or data cleaning
* Reinforcement Learning for Database Tuning
â€¢ Performance implications of AI-enabled queries
â€¢ Case studies of AI-accelerated workloads
â€¢ Social Implications of AI-enabled databases (e.g., De-Biasing)
