Call for Papers for the 2nd Weizenbaum Conference 

Challenges of Digital Inequality: Digital Education | Digital Work | Digital Life

http://weizenbaum-conference.org  

The Weizenbaum Institute for the Networked Society is organising a conference on Thursday, 16 May 
and Friday, 17 May 2019 on the subject of “Challenges of Digital Inequality: Digital Education, Digital 
Work, Digital Life” and invites you to submit short and regular papers for presentation at the 
conference.  The aim of the conference is to bring together different disciplinary perspectives (e.g. 
education and social sciences, legal studies, communication science, computer science, economics 
science and engineering science) to highlight the challenges, drivers and consequences of inequality 
in the age of digitalisation.  In this context, we strive to identify viable solutions to ensure the 
creation of a self-determined society.

Digitalisation transforms the society we live in today: It changes the way we communicate, learn, 
work, and live. Digital technologies provide access to information anytime and anywhere and 
promise to empower users around the world by delivering more and easier opportunities for 
transparency and social participation. Despite this potential, modern societies are increasingly 
witnessing a gaping chasm of inequality as social actors experience differential results of ubiquitous 
digitalisation around the world. Understanding and finding ways to solve this paradox is a primary 
motivation for the Weizenbaum Conference 2019.

For example, the question of whether the digital transformation of education reduces or exacerbates 
inequalities remains open. Indeed, while popular online learning platforms allow global access to 
educational materials for anyone, their use is highly dependent on appropriate Internet access and a 
certain level of Internet skills. Furthermore, many existing online learning platforms are designed for 
specific cultural contexts and frequently fail to account for users with special needs. As a result, 
existing inequalities might be further solidified instead of mitigated. For instance, many refugees 
struggle with a stable Internet connection upon their arrival to a host country which slows down 
their progress of learning the language and impedes social inclusion. In the context of school 
education, available equipment, Internet access, the curriculum, teaching methods as well as 
teachers’ competencies could be contributing factors for inequality. While demands for more 
inclusive ways of education have reached schools, practice reveals pressing challenges that need to 
be overcome. In this context, digital tools may offer solutions, but can also build barriers.

The world of research is also not immune to inequality struggles. Digitalisation is a prerequisite when 
it comes to research collaboration, as well as the production and presentation of research findings. 
Nonetheless, access to research output varies from institution to institution, as does the researchers’ 
ability to publish in the open access format. To address these issues, open access and open research 
data are currently on everyone’s lips, with other aspects of open science, such as citizen science, also 
on the rise.

As labour markets are witnessing tremendous digital transformation, more and more workers choose 
to leverage digital tools to engage in the new “platform economy”, promising more autonomy and 
flexibility. These developments are challenging traditional approaches to the welfare state as well as 
open new gateways for discrimination, which calls for new approaches to address these 
developments. Furthermore, as companies actively embrace digital solutions and automation, 
demands for new digital skill sets and qualifications are pressing. Large enterprises have already 
focused their strategies on developing new competencies in their workforce. However, small and 
medium-sized enterprises are still in the orientation phase and are often lost when it comes to 
developing digital skill strategies for their employees.
On the individual level, digitalisation is blurring the boundaries between personal life and work, 
dividing workers between those who can and those who cannot accommodate to the new realities of 
constant availability. Furthermore, usage patterns, contextual and personality characteristics all 
contribute to the outcomes users obtain online. For example, while active participation on social 
media has been linked to beneficial outcomes such as social connectedness, social capital, and gains 
in social support, passive use of these technologies has been associated with negative outcomes like 
decreased life satisfaction and negative affectivity. Untangling these complexities is a critical research 
challenge to ensure beneficial uses of emerging technologies for all.

Finally, with the growing popularity of automated algorithmic decision-making, there are concerns 
that existing inequalities are solidified as a result of data-driven decisions and inherent biases. Many 
life-changing decisions like whether to keep someone in preventive detention are already relying on 
automated algorithms. Existing inequalities can be aggravated for example if biased data is used as 
the ground truth to train algorithms. At the same time, a lack of transparency impedes the detection 
of inbuilt moral assumptions, biases, and priorities underlying the algorithm. Hence, it is very difficult 
or even impossible for systematically disfavoured groups or individuals to question decisions and 
demand fair re-evaluation.

Taking the lens of digital inequality, this conference seeks contributions that help to steer self-
determined digital transformation in digital education, digital work, and digital life. In line with the 
mission of the Weizenbaum Institute for the Networked Society, we set to explore possibilities to 
shape digital change in a meaningful way.

We invite short papers of 2 pages and regular papers of 7 pages. Conference updates will 
continuously be posted on the Conference website: https://weizenbaum-conference.org

ABOUT THE WEIZENBAUM INSTITUTE
The Weizenbaum Institute investigates the current changes in all aspects of society occurring in 
response to digitalisation. Our goals are to develop a comprehensive understanding of these changes 
based on rigorous academic analysis and to offer informed strategies to address them at a political 
and economic level. The Weizenbaum Institute is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and 
Research with € 50 million over 5 years. The consortium is coordinated by the Berlin Social Science 
Center (WZB) and includes the four Berlin universities – Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-
Universität zu Berlin, Technische Universität Berlin, Universität der Künste Berlin – as well as the 
Universität Potsdam and the Fraunhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems (FOKUS).
The Berlin-Brandenburg Consortium focuses on the interaction of the social sciences, economics and 
law with design research and computer science. Interdisciplinary basic research and the exploration 
of concrete solutions in practice-based labs are combined with knowledge transfer into politics, 
business, and society. The conceptual design of the Institute aims to achieve scientific excellence 
with a nationwide and international impact, as well as networking with cooperation partners from 
civil society, business, politics, and the media.
The institute is named after the computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum, who was born in Berlin in 
1923 and passed away in 2008. His entire life’s work was concerned with the socio-critical dialogue 
between man and machine.
