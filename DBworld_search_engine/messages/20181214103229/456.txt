ï»¿VALUE MODELING AND BUSINESS ONTOLOGY 2019


The 13th International Workshop on Value Modeling and Business Ontology 2019
Call for Papers


Stockholm, Sweden
4 - 5 March, 2019




The importance of modeling the essence of enterprises on a level that abstracts from operational details is increasingly recognized. Two established enterprise modeling approaches are value modeling and business ontology. Business ontology provides abstract descriptions of enterprises in their business context, focusing on what is needed to create and transfer value. Value modeling is a business modeling approach that focuses on the value objects exchanged in business networks.


Increasingly, information systems have a business and consumer value aspect. For example, end-user services such as Netflix and Spotify are information systems that produce economic value directly. In VMBO 2019, we are seeking contributions that investigate the importance of value modeling and business ontology on information system and service design.


The goals of the VMBO workshop series are to bring together researchers with an interest in value modeling and business ontology in order to present and discuss the current state of enterprise or business modeling and to identify key areas for further research, including, specifically but not exclusively, innovative business model design, systemic trust for value exchanges, ontologies for modelling economic concepts and institutions, and value-aware systems design.

If you are interested in joining, please submit a short paper (maximum of four pages) describing your main ideas. We encourage you to focus on ideas in progress for which you would like to get feedback from other workshop participants. We support the submission of VMBO papers afterwards to a special issue of a journal, e.g. Journal of Applied Ontology (JAO) or Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting (JETA), if possible. Note that submitted papers will be reviewed only marginally. The program committee will use the papers to put together a final program; the aim is to accommodate all relevant papers with sufficient quality.
