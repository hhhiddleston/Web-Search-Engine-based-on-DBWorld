********************************************************************************

The MDM series of conferences, since its debut in 1999, has established itself as 
a prestigious forum for the exchange of innovative and significant research results 
in mobile data management. The conference provides unique opportunities to bring 
researchers, engineers, and practitioners together to explore new ideas, techniques, 
and tools, and exchange experiences. 

MDM 2019 aims at providing specialized workshops where researchers and practitioners 
will have an opportunity to explore in a more focused manner, the specific interests 
of mobile data management. In addition to sharing experience, workshops are intended 
to provide a fertile ground for discussing possibly-controversial ideas. 

We invite proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with MDM 2019 - tentatively 
scheduled to take place on June 10 - as preamble to the main conference. An important 
aspect that potential organizers should take into consideration is precisely the 
formatting - both in terms of scope and presentations' organization - so that the main 
objectives identified above are catered to. 

All accepted workshop papers will be published through IEEE Computer Society and the
length of a regular workshop papers is limited to 6 pages - however, the organizers 
may accept even shorter papers with prior notice to the workshop chairs.
