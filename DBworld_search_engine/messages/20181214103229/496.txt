                                to be held in 
              Los Angeles, CA, USA, March 17-20, 2019

ACM IUI 2019 is the 24th annual meeting of the intelligent interfaces community and serves as a premier international forum for reporting outstanding research and development on intelligent user interfaces. In 2019, IUI will be held in the Marriott Marina Del Rey in Los Angeles, CA from March 17th - 20th. 
ACM IUI is where the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community meets the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community, also accepting contributions from related fields such as psychology, behavioral science, cognitive science, computer graphics, design or the arts. This year we especially encourage submissions on explainable intelligent user interfaces for IUI 2019.

** Why you should submit to ACM IUI **
At ACM IUI, we focus on the interaction between machine intelligence and human intelligence. While other conferences focus on one side or the other, we address the complex interaction between the two. We welcome research that explores how to make the interaction between computers and people smarter, which may leverage solutions from data mining, knowledge representation, novel interaction paradigms, and emerging technologies. We strongly encourage submissions that discuss research from both HCI and AI simultaneously, but also welcome works that focus more on one side or the other.  
The conference brings together people from academia, industry and non-profit organizations and gives its participants the opportunity to present and see cutting-edge IUI work in a focused and interactive setting. It is large enough to be diverse and lively, but small enough to allow for extensive interaction among attendees and easy attendance to the events that the conference offers, ranging from oral paper presentations, poster sessions, workshops, panels and doctoral consortium for graduate students.

IUI topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Affective and aesthetic interfaces
- Big Data and analytics
- Collaborative interfaces
- Education and learning-related technologies
- Evaluations of intelligent user interfaces
- Explainable intelligent user interfaces.
- Health and intelligent health technologies 
- Information retrieval and search
- Intelligent assistants for complex tasks
- Intelligent wearable and mobile interfaces 
- Intelligent ubiquitous user interfaces
- Intelligent visualization tools
- Interactive machine learning
- Knowledge-based approaches to user interface design and generation
- Modeling and prediction of user behavior
- Multi-modal interfaces (speech, gestures, eye gaze, face, physiological information etc.)
- Natural language and speech processing
- Persuasive and assistive technologies in IUI
- Planning and plan recognition for IUI
- Proactive and agent-based user interaction
- Recommender systems
- Smart environments and tangible computing
- Social media analysis
- User Modelling for Intelligent Interfaces 
- User-Adaptive interaction and personalization

** Submission - Poster and Demo **
Demos
The demonstrations track complements the overall program of the conference. Demonstrations show implementations of novel, interesting, and important intelligent user interface concepts or systems. We invite submissions relevant to intelligent user interfaces and which address, but are not limited to, the topics of the conference. All submissions are intended to convey a scientific result or work in progress and should not be advertisements for commercial software packages. The page limit for demo papers is 2 pages (including references). Accepted demo papers will be presented as interactive demonstrations at IUI and published in the companion proceedings of the conference.

Posters
Posters provide an opportunity for sharing valuable last-minute ideas, eliciting useful feedback on early-stage work and fostering discussions and collaborations among colleagues. We invite submissions on all topics of the conference. All submissions should convey a scientific result or work in progress that is not yet ready to be published as a full length research paper at a refereed conference. Submitting a draft poster along with your submission is not required but recommended. The page limit for poster papers is 2 pages (including references). Accepted poster papers will appear in the companion proceedings of the conference.
Submission Instructions
Demo and poster submissions do not need to be anonymized. The page limit is 2 pages (including references) in 2-column portrait ACM SIGCHI template (http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). Submitting a draft poster along with your poster submission is not required but recommended.  

Submit your demos and posters at PCS 2.0: https://new.precisionconference.com.
