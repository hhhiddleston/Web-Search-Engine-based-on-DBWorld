The 3rd International Workshop on Affective and Sentimental Computing (ASC 2019) in conjunction with the 6th IEEE International Conference on Big data and smart Computing (BigComp 2019) (http://www.bigcomputing.org/) will bring together the academia, researchers, and industrial practitioners from computer science, information systems, psychology, behavior science, and organization science discipline, and provide a forum for recent advances in the field of sentiment analysis, affective computing, emotion detections, and opinion mining from the perspectives of various computing techniques.
 
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the exploitation of the affective/sentimental models from psychology and cognitive sciences for big data, the identification of emotions/sentiments underlying big data for efficient algorithms for big data management, and the application of affective/sentimental models with social computing techniques in research fields related to (but not limited):

- Sentiment identification & classification
- Emotion identification & classification
- Opinion and sentiment summarization
- Sentiment analysis for social media
- Affective computing for social media
- Time evolving sentiment & emotion analysis
- Knowledge management for affective computing
- Concept-level sentiment analysis
- Social media and social network analysis
- Affective/Sentimental computing for e-learning
- Affective/Sentimental computing for financial data mining
- Affective/Sentimental computing for e-commerce
- Natural language processing techniques for affective computing
- Social ranking
- Social network analysis
- Social tagging analysis
- Affective/Sentimental computing for user modeling
- Data mining algorithms for affective computing
- Big social data analysis
- Information fusion for affective computing
