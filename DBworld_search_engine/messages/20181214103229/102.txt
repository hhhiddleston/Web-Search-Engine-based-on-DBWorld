The theme of the 2019 conference is â€œSisuâ€. Perhaps having no direct English equivalent, Sisu defines the soul of Finland: tenacity of purpose; a relentless perseverance to transform barriers into opportunities; courage in the face of adversity; an action-oriented mindset; a collective choice â€“ we are strong together; and, a love for the long-term potential. We believe that Sisu describes the essence of ICT4S: a collective empowering of people with the idea that there is a strength within us that is greater than the adversities we endure â€“ ICT4S can make a positive difference, to empower an inclusive regeneration.
 
The transformational power of ICT is essential to put our society and all its stakeholders on the path to sustainability. This potential could embrace all levels, from individuals to communities, from the public sector to all industry sectors, from business goals to social aspirations and environmental objectives within a nation and globally. ICT can bring people together to build a thriving, resilient society. Papers relating to ICT for sustainability in a broad sense and papers developing this yearâ€™s theme (and beyond) are welcome.
